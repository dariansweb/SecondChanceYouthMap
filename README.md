## 🧭 Why Was It Built?

To help caseworkers, policymakers, and IT staff alike understand the **pathways youth walk** through the justice system — and to **make better decisions earlier**.

Research-driven and visually engaging, this project brings together real-world policy from:

- **Arkansas** – SAVRY risk assessments + 90-day treatment models
- **Texas** – JCMS tools, diversion-first frameworks
- **Missouri** – “Missouri Model” therapeutic care
- **Louisiana** – Family team decision-making
- **Oklahoma** – Statewide bed and risk data management
- **Mississippi** – Diversion screening (YASI), informal adjustment stats
- **Tennessee** – Child welfare integration, family-centered assessments
