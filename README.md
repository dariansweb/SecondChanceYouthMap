## 🌟 What Is This?

**Second Chance Youth Map** is an open-source intake application built to help juvenile justice teams evaluate and support youth at key decision points — from initial referral to treatment path recommendations.

This app guides users through six structured steps, including:
- 📋 Youth demographic and education info
- ⚖️ Risk and offense factors
- 👥 Contact and stakeholder tracking
- 🧠 Recommendation logic
- 🧾 PDF intake summary generation

It’s responsive, accessible, and deployable on any secure web host (e.g., Vercel).

## 🧠 What Inspired It?

This project draws from real-world practices and models across the Southern U.S., particularly surrounding Arkansas:

- **Arkansas** – Risk-based commitment (SAVRY), 90-day treatment programming
- **Texas** – JCMS system, structured diversion intake forms
- **Missouri** – The Missouri Model: short-term therapeutic intervention focus
- **Louisiana** – Family involvement + MDT (multi-disciplinary team) decision trees
- **Oklahoma** – Real-time data entry and bed tracking infrastructure

Rather than reinvent the wheel, these philosophies were **unified** into a guided, user-friendly intake experience.

## 🏛️ Attribution

This application was developed independently by [**Darian Ross**](https://github.com/dariansweb), an IT professional supporting the **Arkansas Department of Human Services**.

While inspired by practices and workflows used in the **Division of Youth Services (DYS)**, this project is **not an official product** of DHS or DYS. It was created as a **personal civic-tech initiative** to demonstrate how digital tools can better serve youth, families, and staff in juvenile justice settings.
