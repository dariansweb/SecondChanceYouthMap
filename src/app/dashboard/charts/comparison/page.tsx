        What happens when Arkansas and Texas go head-to-head on risk tool policy?
        Or when Missouri&apos;s diversion standards are stacked against Oklahoma&apos;s
        custody triggers? This tool lets you compare states in real-time ‚Äî and
        see how even small legislative shifts create huge youth outcomes.

        This comparison interface is perfect for presentations, agency alignment,
        or onboarding new reform-minded staff. By toggling between states, users
        can visually explore how one system&apos;s philosophy, funding model, or intake
        criteria diverge from another ‚Äî even when serving similar populations.

      <p className="mt-4">
        Youth outcomes aren&apos;t shaped solely by individual behavior ‚Äî
        they&apos;re deeply influenced by the policies around them. Two identical
        youth might receive diversion in one state and detention in another,
        simply because the tools, thresholds, or court culture differ.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        This comparative view isn&apos;t about competition ‚Äî it&apos;s about clarity.
        We learn best not by pretending our systems are perfect, but by holding
        them up to the light, side-by-side. And through that contrast, we discover
        what&apos;s working, what&apos;s missing, and what might be possible.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6 font-semibold text-blue-700">
        At SCYM, we believe that policy clarity creates equity. The more
        accessible our comparisons, the more likely leaders are to adopt what
        works ‚Äî and abandon what doesn&apos;t.
