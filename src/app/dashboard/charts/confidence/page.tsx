          Not all juvenile policy data is created equal. Some states publish
          clear, up-to-date frameworks online â€” while others rely on informal
          guidance, internal memos, or word-of-mouth practice. This chart
          visualizes how confident we are in each state&apos;s policy mappings within
          SCYM.

          Confidence levels are determined by three factors:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 ml-4">
          <li>ðŸ“„ Public documentation (laws, PDFs, manuals)</li>

          This chart helps teams prioritize where to focus research or
          validation. A <strong>High</strong> rating means the policy mapping is
          well-supported by public sources. A <strong>Low</strong> rating means
          more verification is needed before relying on that data.

        <p className="mt-4 italic text-sm text-slate-500">
          These ratings are not judgments of policy quality â€” only of data
          confidence. Some states do great work behind the scenes, but lack
          published documentation.
