      <p>
        Not all juvenile policy data is created equal. Some states publish
        clear, up-to-date frameworks online. Others rely on internal memos,
        informal guidance, or verbal traditions passed between officers. This
        chart visualizes SCYM&apos;s confidence level for each state&apos;s
        policy mappings â€” not based on assumptions, but on traceable
        documentation.

        Confidence levels are determined by three interdependent signals:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 ml-4">
        <li>ðŸ“„ Public documentation (laws, PDFs, manuals)</li>
        <li>ðŸ“… Recency of information (last known update)</li>
        <li>ðŸ“Š Clarity and completeness of the intake process</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-6">
        A <strong>High</strong> confidence rating means we&apos;ve been able to
        confirm the state&apos;s process through official publications. A{" "}
        <strong>Medium</strong> rating indicates partial visibility â€” a chart in
        a PowerPoint, a brief reference in a report. <strong>Low</strong>{" "}
        confidence means most processes are undocumented or rely on secondhand
        information.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 italic text-sm text-slate-500">
        These are not judgments of quality â€” only of accessibility. A state can
        have strong practices behind the scenes and still score low on
        confidence due to lack of transparency. The inverse is also true.

          While static charts show where things stand, this trend view reveals
          *how they&apos;re changing*. Some states have increased documentation
          efforts in recent years â€” while others have stayed stagnant or
          regressed. This chart helps us track whether confidence is earned,
          eroded, or evolving.

        Why does this matter? Because youth don&apos;t just need good policy â€”
        they need visible, predictable systems. Without documentation, no one
        knows if they&apos;re following best practices â€” or just habits.
        Transparency fuels consistency. And consistency protects youth.

      <p className="mt-6 font-semibold text-blue-700">
        At SCYM, we believe that what we don&apos;t know can still shape
        outcomes. Confidence helps us decide where to press in, where to verify,
        and where to shine a light next.
