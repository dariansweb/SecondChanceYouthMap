        Not all juvenile policy data is created equal. Some states publish
        clear, up-to-date frameworks online. Others rely on internal memos,
        informal guidance, or verbal traditions passed between officers.
        This chart visualizes SCYM&apos;s confidence level for each state&apos;s
        policy mappings â€” not based on assumptions, but on traceable documentation.

      <div className="my-10">

      <p className="mt-6">
        Confidence levels are determined by three interdependent signals:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 ml-4">
        <li>ðŸ“„ Public documentation (laws, PDFs, manuals)</li>
        <li>ðŸ“… Recency of information (last known update)</li>
        <li>ðŸ“Š Clarity and completeness of the intake process</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-6">
        A <strong>High</strong> confidence rating means we&apos;ve been able to confirm
        the state&apos;s process through official publications. A{" "}
        <strong>Medium</strong> rating indicates partial visibility â€” a chart in a PowerPoint,
        a brief reference in a report. <strong>Low</strong> confidence means most
        processes are undocumented or rely on secondhand information.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 italic text-sm text-slate-500">
        These are not judgments of quality â€” only of accessibility. A state can
        have strong practices behind the scenes and still score low on confidence
        due to lack of transparency. The inverse is also true.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6">
        Why does this matter? Because youth don&apos;t just need good policy â€”
        they need visible, predictable systems. Without documentation, no one
        knows if they&apos;re following best practices â€” or just habits.
        Transparency fuels consistency. And consistency protects youth.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6 font-semibold text-blue-700">
        At SCYM, we believe that what we don&apos;t know can still shape outcomes.
        Confidence helps us decide where to press in, where to verify, and where
        to shine a light next.
