        While we&apos;ve embedded citations across the app, this page serves as
        a launchpad for full source transparency and civic accountability.
        Behind every visual is a reference â€” and behind every reference is a
        researcher who asked a hard question and found an answer worth sharing.

        SCYM&apos;s glossary and decision matrix were built by hand through
        hundreds of cross-state citations â€” from local circuit forms to
        statewide risk manuals. This isn&apos;t AI-generated filler â€” it&apos;s
        human-curated, source-anchored architecture for justice clarity.

        We believe transparency earns trust. And trust builds systems worth
        following. Our research doesn&apos;t exist in secret â€” it&apos;s open,
        visible, and ready for civic audit. That&apos;s how reform should work.
