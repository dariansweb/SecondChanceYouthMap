        Risk tools are not just paperwork ‚Äî they are decision-making instruments
        that influence who is diverted, detained, or sent deeper into the juvenile
        justice system. In SCYM&apos;s multi-state study of southern juvenile systems,
        we found not just variations in <strong>which tools</strong> are used,
        but striking inconsistency in <strong>how</strong> they are applied.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Instruments like <strong>SAVRY</strong> (Structured Assessment of Violence
        Risk in Youth), <strong>RAI</strong> (Risk Assessment Instrument), and
        <strong>YLS/CMI</strong> (Youth Level of Service / Case Management Inventory)
        are designed to reduce subjectivity ‚Äî but only when used faithfully. Some
        counties automated detention eligibility. Others still rely solely on
        <em>‚Äúprofessional judgment.‚Äù</em> The result is a system where outcomes may
        depend more on geography than on need.
      </p>

        <RiskToolUsageChart />
      </div>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Arkansas integrates the <strong>SAVRY</strong> into law via Act 189,
        using it to determine whether a youth should be committed to DYS. Only
        those assessed as moderate or high risk may be considered for custody ‚Äî
        making the SAVRY not just a guide, but a gatekeeper. Texas favors the
        RAI within its Juvenile Case Management System (JCMS), applied at county
        discretion. Louisiana and Missouri, meanwhile, emphasize therapeutic alignment
        over strict scoring ‚Äî sometimes allowing risk evaluation to emerge from
        a multidisciplinary team process rather than a tool.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-sm italic text-slate-500">
        ‚ÄúA tool should never replace human discernment, but it should inform it.
        When tools are ignored or inconsistently applied, equity erodes.‚Äù

      {/* HEATMAP CONTEXT */}
      <p className="mb-4">
        But presence alone isn&apos;t enough. SCYM developed a parallel framework to
        assess <strong>confidence</strong> in each state&apos;s use of risk tools ‚Äî
        based on what&apos;s public: training manuals, court documents, intake guidelines,
        and agency reports. Confidence reflects transparency, not effectiveness.
        A missing tool may not mean it&apos;s unused ‚Äî but it does mean it&apos;s undocumented,
        unverified, and unauditable.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Some states publish their full screening tools. Others mention them only
        in brief references or internal memos. Mississippi, for example, showed
        almost no publicly accessible evidence of tool usage ‚Äî not in legislation,
        not in court guidance, not in agency reports.

        This heatmap visualizes not just adoption, but the opacity of the system.
        A green square signals documentation and public access. Medium means the tool
        is mentioned but not shared. Low reflects anecdotal or outdated reference.
        A dash (‚Äî) means no confirmation at all.

      {/* CLOSING */}
      <p className="mb-4">
        Inconsistent application of tools isn&apos;t a small detail ‚Äî it shapes lives.
        One youth in Arkansas may receive a structured assessment, leading to
        diversion. A youth in Mississippi may face secure detention based solely
        on officer discretion. These are not anomalies ‚Äî they are system truths.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold text-blue-700">
        At SCYM, we believe that transparency is the first step toward equity.
        A tool that is buried or ignored cannot be held accountable.
        Uniform access and honest application of risk instruments
        must be part of the path forward ‚Äî because real reform requires both heart
        and infrastructure.
