        This chart highlights which states contributed the richest set of
        verified sources â€” from policy PDFs and risk assessment manuals, to
        education audits and mental health screening protocols. Every citation
        is a breadcrumb in the story of reform.

        SCYM doesn&apos;t treat references as footnotes â€” we see them as the
        backbone of responsible design. States with more source citations
        typically allowed deeper exploration, clearer alignment to intake
        workflows, and a broader lens on how youth justice is structured.

        Transparency is a design feature. States with more sources don&apos;t
        just show more â€” they invite trust, civic participation, and honest
        analysis. That&apos;s a trend worth watching.

        At SCYM, we believe that reform starts with research â€” but it ends in
