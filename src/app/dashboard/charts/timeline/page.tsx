        Every step in the youth intake process builds upon the last ‚Äî from
        referral to assessment, from service planning to eventual outcome. This
        timeline maps out a model progression of decision points that shape a
        youth&apos;s experience ‚Äî not as a static sequence, but as a dynamic
        flow of influence, accountability, and care.

      <p className="mt-4">
        It&apos;s not just a map ‚Äî it&apos;s a mirror. Intake without reflection
        often leads to procedural overreach or missed moments of grace. When
        youth fall through the cracks, it&apos;s often because no one stopped to
        ask where they were on the journey ‚Äî and whether they belonged in that
        path at all.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        By visualizing the full lifecycle ‚Äî from first contact to community
        reentry ‚Äî we uncover critical windows for <strong>diversion</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>intervention</strong>, and <strong>support planning</strong>. It
        becomes easier to see when delays stack up, when evaluations are
        skipped, or when services are offered too late to help.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 font-semibold text-blue-700">
        At SCYM, we believe that timelines should serve youth ‚Äî not systems. A
        just path is not just one that moves forward ‚Äî it&apos;s one that
        listens, redirects, and restores at every gate.
