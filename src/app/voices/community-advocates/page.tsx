        You show up when others don&apos;t. You speak up when the court is
        silent. You call, mentor, drive, knock, explain ‚Äî over and over. SCYM
        data shows that in states with strong community-based diversion and
        mentoring programs, youth outcomes improve dramatically. Your presence
        creates possibility.

        You build the bridge. You hold the line. You sit in the lobby and
        advocate for a second call, a delayed placement, a better plan. You are
        the thread connecting systems to souls. And without your work, justice
        is incomplete.
