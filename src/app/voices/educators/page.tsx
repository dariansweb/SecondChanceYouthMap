      <p>
        Long before a youth enters the system, they&apos;re often struggling in
        school. You see the missed days, the frustrated eyes, the incomplete
        IEPs. SCYM data reveals a clear pattern: educational instability is one
        of the strongest predictors of future system involvement ‚Äî but also one
        of the most powerful opportunities for early intervention.

          In multiple states, youth flagged for IEPs and truancy during intake
          were nearly twice as likely to require multi-agency coordination. Your
          records, referrals, and school-based interventions are critical system
          signals.

        stayed after class and asked if I was okay. That was the first time I
        told anyone about what was happening at home.‚Äù

        Every time you document attendance with care, file an IEP properly, or
        advocate for school-based supports instead of suspension ‚Äî you become
        the frontline of justice reform. You help youth get seen, not sentenced.
