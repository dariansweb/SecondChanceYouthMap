      <p>
        You work in the space between accountability and compassion. For many
        youth, you&apos;re not just an officer ‚Äî you&apos;re the first adult who
        listens, checks in, and shows up. SCYM data shows that youth on
        probation experience better outcomes when they&apos;re paired with
        proactive, consistent support.

          In several states, more than half of all intake outcomes result in
          probation ‚Äî not custody. That means the majority of youth move forward
          under your care.

      <p>
        Youth on probation are often balancing trauma, school pressure, and
        unstable home environments. Your structure, your belief in their
        potential, and your willingness to enforce boundaries *and* celebrate
        growth ‚Äî it&apos;s transformative.
