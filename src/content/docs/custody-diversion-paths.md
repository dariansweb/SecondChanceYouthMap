# ⚖️ Custody vs. Diversion Pathways

This document explores the two primary directions youth may be routed after intake: **state custody** or **diversion programming**. Each pathway has different requirements, implications, and support needs.

---

## 🛤️ What Are the Two Paths?

### 1. **Diversion**

A structured alternative to formal adjudication and detention, often used for low to moderate risk youth.

- Focus on community support, therapy, accountability
- Avoids formal court records in many cases
- Reduces system involvement and recidivism

### 2. **State Custody / Commitment**

Used when diversion is not appropriate or risk is too high.

- May include short-term treatment (e.g., 60–90 days)
- Often accompanied by court order and MDT recommendation
- Triggers placement in a licensed facility or residential program

---

## 🧮 Decision Criteria

### ✅ Consider for Diversion:

- Low or moderate risk score
- No prior serious violent offenses
- Strong guardian or school support
- Offense is non-felony or first-time
- Willingness to comply with services

### ❗ Consider for State Custody:

- High or violent risk classification
- History of failed diversion attempts
- Lack of family or supervision options
- Serious or repeat offenses
- Court mandate or safety concerns

---

## 🧠 Integrated MDT Review

A **Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)** meeting may be held to review:

- Youth's strengths and risks
- Risk assessment data
- Family engagement capacity
- Program availability and fit
- Education, behavioral, or medical needs

---

## 🔄 Flexibility in the Model

The SCYM app is designed to:

- Allow either pathway to be recommended at intake
- Provide justification fields for every decision
- Support changes later in the process (e.g. diversion fails, court orders custody)
- Auto-flag risk score inconsistencies

## 📝 Sample Recommendations

| Scenario | Pathway | Justification |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| First-time theft | Diversion | Youth is 13, no priors, engaged in school |
| Aggressive assault | Custody | Risk score: 42, no stable home, prior violence |
| Truancy w/ IEP | Diversion | School & guardian agree to wraparound services |
| Gang-related threat | Custody | High risk, MDT consensus, safety concern |

---

## 🌍 Best Practice Alignment

| State | Practice |
|-------|----------|
| **Arkansas** | 90-day treatment option for high-risk youth |
| **Texas** | Built-in diversion triggers at intake |
| **Missouri** | Early engagement of MDT for all placements |
| **Louisiana** | Family input required before custody placement |
| **Oklahoma** | Bed space availability drives detention decisions |

---

## 🌟 Final Thought

Custody is not failure. Diversion is not forgiveness.  
Both are tools — the key is using them *intentionally*, and *accountably*.
