# 🎓 Educational Planning & Support

When a youth enters the juvenile justice system, their education doesn't stop — it simply changes location. This document outlines how to preserve educational continuity through intake, diversion, custody, and reentry.

---

## 🧠 Why Education Matters at Intake

- Interruptions in schooling lead to higher dropout rates
- Youth in custody often face gaps in credit, services, or enrollment
- Educational engagement is a protective factor in reducing recidivism
- Intake is often the *only* time agencies get accurate school data

> “A child’s academic record should travel with them — not behind them.”

---

## 📋 What to Collect During Intake

- Current school name and contact info
- Grade level and transcript/credit status
- Special education status:
  - Individualized Education Plan (IEP)
  - 504 Plan
- Language and learning support needs
- Truancy or chronic absenteeism notes
- Past discipline incidents (optional)

---

## 🏫 Enrollment Continuity by Path

### If Placed in Diversion:

- Ensure youth remains enrolled in their home school
- Communicate service schedules (therapy, court, community hours) to school
- Include academic goals in the diversion contract

### If Placed in Custody:

- Begin immediate transfer of records to facility-based school
- Assign educational liaison (case manager, intake officer, or probation staff)
- Maintain IEP/504 status under IDEA and federal protections

---

## 📎 Supporting Special Education Needs

- Federal law **does not stop at the intake door**
- If a youth has an active IEP or 504:
  - It must be continued in the new setting
  - Re-evaluations should be done if needs shift
  - Services must be documented and tracked

- IDEA applies in:
  - Juvenile detention centers
  - Residential treatment
  - Alternative schools
  - Diversion-based tutoring or mentorship

---

## 🔁 Reentry & School Reintegration

- Provide a **transition packet** back to school
- Hold a reentry meeting with:
  - Youth
  - Guardian
  - School counselor or admin
  - Case worker or probation officer
- Discuss:
  - Attendance goals
  - Course schedule
  - Support services
  - Safety and behavior plan (if applicable)

> “We’re not just closing a case — we’re reopening a classroom.”
