# 🧭 Intake Workflow

This document outlines the standard intake workflow developed for the **Second Chance Youth Map** project. It combines legal requirements, best practices, and insights from Arkansas and neighboring states.

---

## 🚨 Step 1: Youth Encounter / Referral

- **Trigger Points:** Arrest, citation, school referral, probation violation
- **Initial Info Collected:** 
  - Youth’s name, DOB, demographics
  - Referral type and source
  - Basic school status

---

## 📋 Step 2: Intake Form Completion

- **Conducted by:** Intake Officer or Case Manager
- **Collected Data Includes:**
  - Offense details
  - Risk assessment score (SAVRY, RAI, etc.)
  - Educational status (IEP/504, credits, truancy)
  - Stakeholders: Guardians, case workers, school staff
  - Recommendation: Diversion, Probation, State Custody

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Risk Assessment Integration

- Risk score tools must be:
  - Research-backed
  - Culturally neutral
  - Documented clearly
- Score thresholds influence suggested pathways

---

## ⚖️ Step 4: Recommendation + Legal Review

- **Options:**
  - Diversion program
  - Probation supervision
  - State custody (up to 90 days)
- Legal parties and MDT teams collaborate before court review.

---

## 🏫 Step 5: Education Continuity Planning

- Youths must be offered an uninterrupted educational path
- If detained, enrollment is maintained or transitioned
- Education services are included in the intake packet

---

## 📝 Step 6: Final Review & Submission

- A PDF intake summary is generated
- Sent to:
  - Juvenile judge
  - Probation supervisor
  - Educational liaison

---

## 🔄 What Happens After Intake?

Once the intake summary is submitted:

- Youth may be scheduled for court appearance
- Diversion programs can begin immediately (if pre-court approved)
- Custody orders may activate a 60–90 day treatment window
- MDT (Multidisciplinary Teams) begin planning service coordination

---

## 🌟 Closing Thought

Every step of the intake process should reflect a single truth:

> "Youth deserve not just a system — they deserve a map that leads them somewhere better."

Designed to be flexible for local adoption, this workflow invites states, counties, and teams to make it their own — but always with the youth's future at the center.
