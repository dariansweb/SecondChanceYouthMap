# 🗺️ Second Chance Youth Map Documentation

---

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Second Chance Youth Map** — a project created to reimagine the way youth are assessed, referred, and supported through juvenile justice systems in Arkansas and its neighboring states.

This section provides the **context and rationale** behind each design choice, drawing from proven practices, legal frameworks, and innovations across state systems.

---

## 🌱 Why This Project Exists

This project was born out of a need to simplify and humanize the juvenile justice intake process — giving youth a better chance through clarity, consistency, and compassion.

In many jurisdictions, the youth intake process remains tangled in paper, inconsistent logic, or disconnected systems. This can lead to:

- Delayed decision-making  
- Misdirected placements  
- Lack of educational tracking  
- Inadequate communication between agencies  

Our goal is to change that.

The Second Chance Youth Map was designed to:

- Guide intake officers step-by-step  
- Evaluate risk and protective factors transparently  
- Track stakeholders (legal, school, mental health, family)  
- Provide justifiable recommendations  
- Maintain education continuity  
- Export printable PDF summaries for collaboration or court

## 🔍 Core Objectives

- 🧭 **Support data-informed diversion**
- ⚖️ **Map legally required intake data**
- 🧠 **Visualize decision trees**
- 📘 **Preserve educational continuity**
- 🛠️ **Create transparent and repeatable intake tools**
- 🌍 **Adapt to any state or county’s context**

## 🔥 Inspired by Real Models

We studied real-world practices across Arkansas and neighboring states:

### 🔹 Arkansas
- Use of **SAVRY**
- 90-day risk-based treatment commitment windows
- Emphasis on diversion pathways when feasible

### 🔹 Texas
- Juvenile Case Management System (**JCMS**) for digital intake
- Diversion options embedded in structured forms

### 🔹 Missouri
- The **Missouri Model**: short-term, therapeutic, community-based commitments
- Strong emphasis on positive youth development

### 🔹 Louisiana
- Family engagement embedded from the beginning
- Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) logic trees for shared decisions

### 🔹 Oklahoma
- Real-time data entry tools
- Bed tracking and RAI scoring to reduce unnecessary detention

These state innovations became the *architectural DNA* of this project.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a centralized digital intake tool
- Streamline referral, assessment, and decision-making
- Encourage diversion over detention
- Make decisions transparent and defensible
- Respect and document a youth’s full story — not just their charge
- Allow for open-source replication, evolution, and adoption
