## ⚖️ Why This Matters

Juvenile justice systems hold deeply personal information about minors. This includes:

- Legal history  
- Family background  
- School performance  
- Mental health data  
- Medical diagnoses  

Protecting this information is not just a matter of law — it's a matter of dignity, trauma-informed practice, and trust.
