# 📊 Risk Assessments

Risk assessment is a foundational component of the juvenile intake process. It helps ensure youth are placed in the **least restrictive environment** appropriate to their needs, safety risk, and support system.

---

## 🔎 Purpose

Risk assessments are used to:

- Evaluate the **likelihood of reoffending**
- Determine the presence of **protective and risk factors**
- Guide whether a youth should be diverted, placed on probation, or committed
- Document defensible reasoning for judicial recommendations

> “A score is a signal — not a sentence.”

## ✅ Best Practice Tips
