Sweet. I'm diving deep into comparative state-level juvenile justice workflows with a laser focus on decision points—the "voices" that hold sway over a youth's path through the system. I’ll be mapping decision trees, surfacing state-by-state intake logic, and showing how those workflows support or hinder positive outcomes.

You’ll get workflow diagrams and comparisons across key jurisdictions to help sculpt tools that empower every voice in the process to choose wisely, compassionately, and with clarity.

Hang tight, Dude—this is gonna be enlightening.

# Comparative Analysis of Juvenile Justice Intake and Decision-Making Workflows Across U.S. States

## Introduction and Key Decision Points in Juvenile Intake
The juvenile justice process involves a series of decision points from the moment of a youth’s contact with law enforcement to the final disposition of a case. At each stage, different stakeholders (“voices” such as police, intake officers, prosecutors, judges, probation officers, parents, etc.) influence whether a young person is diverted from formal processing, maintained in the community under supervision, or placed in state custody. While specifics vary by state, the overall structure of decision-making is similar. **Figure 1** below illustrates a typical juvenile case flow with major decision nodes (diversion vs. referral, intake screening, formal petition, detention, adjudication, disposition, and aftercare):

 ([Case Flow Diagram | Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/statistical-briefing-book/structure_process/case)) *Figure 1: Generic flow chart of juvenile justice case processing, showing decision points from law enforcement contact through court intake, diversion or formal processing, adjudication, and disposition (probation, residential placement, and aftercare)* ([Case Flow Diagram | Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/statistical-briefing-book/structure_process/case#:~:text=enforcement)) ([Case Flow Diagram | Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/statistical-briefing-book/structure_process/case#:~:text=involving%20youth%20in%202019%20were,were%20referred%20to%20juvenile%20court))

In general, the process begins with **law enforcement**. When a youth is apprehended for an offense, the **police officer** must decide whether to **divert** the youth or **refer** the case into the formal system ([Case Flow Diagram | Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/statistical-briefing-book/structure_process/case#:~:text=Law%20enforcement%20diverts%20many%20youth,were%20referred%20to%20juvenile%20court)). Many states encourage or authorize officers to handle low-level offenses informally – for example, by issuing a warning or citation, or referring the youth to a community program in lieu of arrest ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=common%20workflow%20in%20these%20states,com%20%E2%80%8B)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%20versustexas,often)). If the offense is serious or the officer deems formal action necessary, the youth is taken into custody and a **complaint or referral** is made to the juvenile court or juvenile intake department.

Next, an **intake screening** is conducted, usually by a **juvenile probation intake officer** (sometimes called a court counselor or intake officer) or, in certain jurisdictions, by a prosecutor’s office. At this stage, the intake officer reviews the case details, meets with the youth and family, and often administers **risk assessment and mental health screening tools** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Intake%20Screening%3A%20If%20a%20youth,wide%E2%80%8B%20craigheadcountyar.gov)). Common screening instruments include the MAYSI-2 (Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument) to flag mental or behavioral health needs ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=this%20stage%2C%20the%20intake%20officer,is%20crafted%2C%20in%20which%20the)), and a **Risk Assessment Instrument (RAI)** to objectively gauge the youth’s risk of reoffending or failing to appear in court. Based on the offense severity, the youth’s history, and the assessment results, the intake officer must decide one of several paths: **diversion** (also called “adjustment” or “informal adjustment” in some states), or **formal processing** by filing a petition in juvenile court ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=%29,court%20or%20drug%20court%20as)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=educational%20or%20counseling%20program%2C%20or,they%20must%20consent%20to%20the)).

If the case is **diverted**, the youth avoids formal adjudication. Instead, an agreement is crafted with certain conditions (such as counseling, community service, restitution to any victim, a curfew, etc.) that the youth must fulfill ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Diversion%3A%20If%20the%20offense%20is,court%20or%20drug%20court%20as)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,completion%20leads%20to%20case%20closure%E2%80%8B)). The **parent/guardian’s involvement** is typically required at this stage – most states require the guardian to consent to and sign the diversion contract, underscoring that the process is voluntary for the youth ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=which%20successful%20completion%20leads%20to,this%20stage%20if%20restitution%20or)). Diversion periods usually last a few months (commonly 3 to 6 months) and, if the youth successfully completes the conditions, the case is closed without a delinquency record ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=educational%20or%20counseling%20program%2C%20or,they%20must%20consent%20to%20the)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=on%20the%20order%20of%20a,%E2%80%8B)). If the youth fails diversion or is deemed ineligible (e.g. due to a serious violent offense or repeated prior offenses), the case proceeds formally.

If a **petition** is filed, the case enters the formal court process. The first court hearing is often a **detention or probable-cause hearing** held within 24–72 hours of the youth’s custody ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=childrens,reason%20to%20hold%20the%20youth)). Here, a **juvenile court judge** reviews whether there is sufficient reason to detain the youth pending the case outcome ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=childrens,youth%20to%20a%20state%20custody)). This decision is frequently guided by the RAI score and statutory criteria – youths assessed as low-risk are usually **released to a parent or placed on alternative-to-detention supervision** (like home detention or electronic monitoring), whereas higher-risk youths or those with serious charges may be **held in a juvenile detention facility** for the safety of the community or to ensure appearance in court ([](https://djj.georgia.gov/document/document/jj-system-flow-chart-2022pdf/download#:~:text=Detention%20Assessment%20Instrument%20,the%20clerk%20Offense%20Occurs%20Informal)) ([](https://djj.georgia.gov/document/document/jj-system-flow-chart-2022pdf/download#:~:text=Continue%20in%20Detention%20or%20Alternative,Juvenile%20Court%20Detention%20Hearing%20Dismissed)). Afterward, the case moves to adjudication (the fact-finding hearing). If the youth is found **not delinquent** (not guilty), the case is dismissed. If the youth is **adjudicated delinquent**, a **disposition hearing** determines the consequences.

At disposition, the key choice is typically between a **community-based disposition** (probation and services in the community) versus placement in a **state custody program** (commitment to a residential juvenile facility). This decision point is often where a **structured risk and needs assessment** heavily influences outcomes ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Decision%3A%20Probation%20vs%20State%20Custody%3A,gov%20%E2%80%8B)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=is%20whether%20to%20place%20the,term%20county)). Judges rely on recommendations from probation or multidisciplinary teams that consider the youth’s assessed risk level, needs, and the least restrictive option that still protects public safety. Many states have explicit policies or laws guiding this decision – for instance, using **disposition matrices** or banning commitment for low-level offenses – to ensure only the highest-risk or most serious cases result in state custody ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,in%20community%20programs%2C%20and%20state)) ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=Department%E2%80%99s%20recommendation%20should%20deviate%20from,that%20appropriate%20juvenile%20services%20and)). In practice, this means the vast majority of youth in these jurisdictions are kept in the community (diversion or probation), and state commitment is a last resort ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,Program%20Durations%20and%20Treatment%20Timeframes)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=scores%20and%20offense%20severity,youth%20to%20state%20facilities%20for)). If a youth is committed to a state juvenile agency, they typically receive rehabilitative services in a youth facility for a period, followed by **aftercare** (juvenile parole or reentry supervision) to help them transition back to the community ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=detention%20as%20a%20disposition%20in,a%20jail%20diversion%2C%20for%20example%E2%80%8B)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Lafayette%20Parish%20Evening%20Reporting%20Center,For%20instance%2C%20Arkansas%E2%80%99)).

Throughout all stages, certain **youth rights and protections** apply. Youth have a right to counsel during critical proceedings (and many states appoint an attorney at the earliest detention hearing). Parents or guardians must be notified of the proceedings and are encouraged (or required) to participate, especially in diversion agreements and case planning. **Educational continuity** is also a legal and practical mandate: if a youth is held in detention or placed in a program, the system must provide schooling and ensure that credits transfer when the youth returns to their community school ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Educational%20Planning%20and%20Handling%20of,A%20few%20notable%20models)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=educational%20and%20other%20rehabilitative%20services%E2%80%9D,responsible%20for%20schooling%20the%20youth%E2%80%8B)). Information-sharing and coordination (often via digital case management systems) are crucial so that all stakeholders – from probation officers to schools – stay aligned on the youth’s status and needs.

The following sections provide a detailed **state-by-state (or jurisdictional) analysis** of how these intake and decision-making workflows are structured, highlighting the key decision-makers, tools, forms, youth/guardian involvement, and technology platforms in each. We include recent updates (since 2022) and additional states beyond the initial set (Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Tennessee) covered in the earlier research document. Each state’s workflow is mapped with an emphasis on the critical decision points and the “voices” influencing the youth’s pathway toward either diversion, continued community placement, or deeper system involvement.

## State-by-State Workflows and Decision Points

### Arkansas
**Legal/Procedural Structure:** Arkansas’ juvenile intake is somewhat decentralized – each judicial district has juvenile intake officers (often part of the local juvenile court). The state has, however, established uniform guidance through law and training. Notably, **Arkansas law (Act 189 of 2019)** requires use of validated risk assessment in juvenile cases, and the Administrative Office of Courts provides a statewide database for juvenile officers to enter risk data ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=bit%20more%20decentralized%20,performance%20dashboards%20and%20statistical%20reports)). When a youth is referred to juvenile court in Arkansas, an intake officer (juvenile probation) reviews the allegation. Minor first-time offenders can be diverted per Arkansas Code without formal court involvement. Arkansas law explicitly enumerates diversion options: referral to community-based programs, nonjudicial probation under supervision, enrollment in educational or counseling programs, teen court, drug court, etc. ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,completion%20leads%20to%20case%20closure%E2%80%8B)). These options are formalized as an **“informal adjustment agreement”** that the youth and guardian must sign (consenting to fulfill conditions like counseling or community service) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=which%20successful%20completion%20leads%20to,this%20stage%20if%20restitution%20or)). The agreement typically lasts 3–6 months, after which successful completion results in the case being dismissed with no adjudication ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=educational%20or%20counseling%20program%2C%20or,they%20must%20consent%20to%20the)). If the youth doesn’t comply, or if the offense is too serious for diversion, the case is petitioned to juvenile court for formal processing.

**Key Decision-Makers:** The **juvenile intake officer** has significant discretion at the front end to recommend diversion or petition. In practice, many Arkansas jurisdictions convene a **“state’s attorney review”** as well for serious cases – the prosecutor may be consulted before deciding not to file a petition. Ultimately, if a petition is filed, a **judge** oversees detention decisions and adjudication. Judges in Arkansas closely follow risk-based guidance at disposition: by policy and law, **commitment to state custody (Division of Youth Services, DYS)** is reserved for youth who are moderate or high risk and in need of secure placement ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=services%20like%20therapy%2C%20mentoring%2C%20etc,term%20county)). In fact, Arkansas statutorily mandates that low-risk youth should not be sent to DYS at all ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=release%20,Instead%2C%20it)). This legal framework means judges will favor probation or local alternatives for low-risk offenders, using state commitment only as a last resort for higher-risk cases ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,Program%20Durations%20and%20Treatment%20Timeframes)). Judges also have an intermediate option: Arkansas law allows an adjudicated youth to be ordered to a county-run juvenile detention facility for up to 90 days as a disposition, with rehabilitative services on-site, instead of committing the youth to DYS ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,term%20programs%20%28the)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=detention%20as%20a%20disposition%20in,term)). This provides a short-term, local custody option and is an example of a structured decision point – the judge evaluates if a youth can be appropriately served in a local setting or truly requires state custody.

**Risk Assessment Tools:** Arkansas has implemented the **SAVRY (Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth)** statewide as its risk/needs assessment tool at intake and disposition. Intake officers complete a brief screening (often derived from SAVRY or a detention RAI) to inform the initial decision. If the case goes to disposition, a full SAVRY assessment is done and the risk level must be reported to the court (Arkansas’s DYS policies emphasize data-driven decisions using these scores) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=making%3A%20having%20clear%20criteria%20or,youth%20to%20state%20facilities%20for)). Additionally, Arkansas uses the MAYSI-2 mental health screening for all detained youth or those under assessment ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=this%20stage%2C%20the%20intake%20officer,is%20crafted%2C%20in%20which%20the)). The **threshold for diversion** in Arkansas is generally a combination of low severity offense and low risk score – if those conditions are met, intake officers are inclined (and in some jurisdictions, required by local policy) to pursue an informal adjustment. The state’s recent reforms encourage using diversion whenever public safety is not at risk ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=scores%20and%20offense%20severity,youth%20to%20state%20facilities%20for)).

**Standardized Forms/Documentation:** Arkansas provides standardized forms for **Diversion Agreements** and **Intake Risk Assessment**. The diversion (informal adjustment) form outlines the conditions and must be signed by the youth, guardian, intake officer, and approved by a judge (in some districts) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=which%20successful%20completion%20leads%20to,this%20stage%20if%20restitution%20or)). For formal cases, the **petition form** and **detention risk assessment form** are standard across the state (the risk form is tied to Act 189 requirements). All intake information is entered into the state’s JCP (Juvenile Court Programs) database, which feeds into a central system. On the state custody side, Arkansas DYS maintains a **case management system** for committed youth and even publishes performance dashboards using those data ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=arcourts,performance%20dashboards%20and%20statistical%20reports)). This means from intake through commitment, data are captured consistently. Key data fields at intake include personal info, offense details, referral source, RAI score, and whether the case was diverted ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=constitutes%20a%20%E2%80%9Creferral%E2%80%9D%2C%20what%20disposition,all%20who%20need%20to%20know%E2%80%8B)) – aligning with national best practices on data standards.

**Youth Rights & Family Involvement:** Arkansas law ensures that parents/guardians are notified immediately when a juvenile is taken into custody. In diversion, as noted, the guardian’s written consent is needed. Youth in Arkansas have the right to counsel at all critical stages; if a petition is filed, an attorney (public defender) is appointed. During intake interviews, anything the youth says as part of a screening or assessment generally cannot be used against them in court adjudication (to encourage candid participation in assessments). Arkansas also requires that victims be consulted if restitution or apology is part of a diversion plan ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=which%20successful%20completion%20leads%20to,or%20a%20history%20of%20prior)) – the victim’s voice can influence the conditions set (e.g., amount of restitution). **Educational continuity**: Arkansas has taken notable steps in this area. State law (Ark. Code §6-20-104) mandates that when a youth is in a juvenile detention facility (even for that up-to-90-day disposition), the facility “must provide educational and other rehabilitative services” ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=highlight%20how%20educational%20planning%20is,%E2%80%9Cmust%20provide)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=educational%20and%20other%20rehabilitative%20services%E2%80%9D,responsible%20for%20schooling%20the%20youth%E2%80%8B)). Detention centers coordinate with local school districts so the youth’s education is not interrupted. Furthermore, any public school (and state education funds) must continue to treat the detained youth as enrolled, and can draw funding to support educational services during detention ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L468%20apply%20for,and%20that)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=apply%20for%20state%20education%20funds,and%20that)). At intake, Arkansas officers collect the youth’s school information and any special education status ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=importance%20of%20capturing%20education%20information,that%20at%20the%20moment%20of)); if a youth is detained or committed, an education liaison uses that info to promptly request records from the school and plan for the youth’s academic needs ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L479%20have%20an,Louisiana%E2%80%99s%20OJJ%2C%20for%20example%2C%20has)). This structure helps ensure the youth doesn’t fall behind academically due to justice system involvement.

**Digital Tools:** While Arkansas does not yet have a single unified system from intake through reentry, it has several interoperable parts. The Administrative Office of Courts’ **juvenile officer database** allows intake officers to log risk assessment results (Act 189 data) and tracks each case through diversion or petition ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=bit%20more%20decentralized%20,maintains%20a%20case%20management%20system)). On the state side, DYS’s system serves as the “system of record” for committed youth ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=arcourts,performance%20dashboards%20and%20statistical%20reports)). Arkansas is moving toward more integration; for example, they have been training staff on data entry to ensure the court intake data and DYS data can be analyzed together. An example of digital support: if a low-risk youth’s data is entered with a plan to commit to DYS, the system could flag this as inconsistent with Arkansas law (which discourages committing low-risk youth) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=release%20,Instead%2C%20it)). Indeed, a proposed feature for decision-support apps is to incorporate these rules – e.g., a prompt saying “Youth is low risk – consider diversion or alternative” if someone tries to select a deep-end option ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%20humanservices,helps%20operationalize%20the%20legal%20framework)). This kind of built-in guidance mirrors Arkansas’ policy and helps frontline staff align with best practices.

### Texas
**Legal/Procedural Structure:** Texas has a bifurcated system: County juvenile probation departments handle intake, diversion, and probation, while the state agency (Texas Juvenile Justice Department, TJJD) handles any commitments to state facilities. A notable aspect in Texas is the **age of juvenile jurisdiction remains under 17** (as of 2025) – 17-year-olds are treated as adults, which is different from most states ([[2021 Session] “Raise the Age”: Hold 17-Year-Olds Accountable in the Juvenile Justice System | Texas CJE](https://texascje.org/2021-session-raise-age-hold-17-year-olds-accountable-juvenile-justice-system#:~:text=In%20Texas%2C%2017,sense%20approach)). Therefore, Texas’ juvenile workflow applies to youth 16 and under (though legislative efforts to “Raise the Age” are ongoing). When a youth is arrested in Texas, the law enforcement officer has discretion for **first-time and low-level offenses** to not formally detain or refer to court. Texas law authorizes **First Offender Programs** and police-led diversions: for example, an officer can issue a citation and refer a youth to a local *First Offender Program* instead of taking them into custody ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=citation%20,memoranda%20of%20understanding%20with%20juvenile)). Many police departments in Texas have Memoranda of Understanding with probation to allow a “cite and release” process – the youth is sent to a community program or mentorship course and no formal record is generated ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%20versustexas,often)). This front-end diversion is one critical decision point influenced by law enforcement “voices.” If the officer proceeds formally, the youth is referred to the county **juvenile probation department** for intake. In Texas, intake probation officers are required by TJJD standards to administer a **Risk and Needs Assessment (RANA)** for each referred youth ([[PDF] TJJD Risk and Needs Assessment Training - Texas.gov](https://www2.tjjd.texas.gov/statistics/2014_Data_Conference/RANA%20Instrument%20Training.pdf#:~:text=Texas,RANA)), as well as a mental health screening (MAYSI-2 is widely used) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=this%20stage%2C%20the%20intake%20officer,is%20crafted%2C%20in%20which%20the)). Based on the results and offense, the intake officer, often in consultation with the county prosecutor, decides whether to **adjust (divert) the case, handle it informally, or refer it for petition** in juvenile court. Many Texas counties have formal **Deferred Prosecution** programs (typically 6-month diversion contracts) for first-time misdemeanors. If the case is petitioned, a juvenile judge or referee will hold a **detention hearing within 2 business days**, per Texas Family Code. Texas uses a **Detention Risk Assessment Instrument (DRAI)** in many jurisdictions (TJJD provides a model) to guide detaining vs. releasing youth pending trial ([Juvenile Detention Risk Assessment - The Annie E. Casey Foundation](https://www.aecf.org/resources/a-practice-guide-to-juvenile-detention-reform-1#:~:text=Juvenile%20Detention%20Risk%20Assessment%20,related%20risks)). At disposition, Texas law explicitly **prohibits commitment to state facilities for misdemeanor offenses** (except in rare situations) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,in%20community%20programs%2C%20and%20state)). This is a huge structural limiter – it forces local alternatives for lesser offenses. Only felony-level or chronic offenders can be sent to TJJD state custody, and even then the judge must consider if the youth can be served in a local county program or residential treatment first. In fact, the **vast majority of Texas youth are supervised locally**: over 95% of youth under probation supervision never go to a state facility, reflecting Texas’ emphasis on community-based outcomes ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Texas%E2%80%99%20Diversion%20Investments%20and%20JCMS,a%20brief%20mental%20health%20screen)).

**Key Decision-Makers:** Key actors in Texas include the **juvenile probation officer (JPO)** at intake, who conducts assessments and initially recommends diversion or referral; the **county prosecutor**, who in many counties must approve filing of a petition (and can dismiss or divert cases at their discretion); and the **juvenile court judge**, who makes detention and disposition decisions. Because of statutory rules (like no state commitment for misdemeanors), judges in Texas channel youth toward local dispositions. County **juvenile boards** (policy boards for each department) also influence available programs – for example, some counties have specialty courts (drug court, mental health court) that an intake officer might refer a youth to as a diversion track. Probation officers in Texas often convene **multidisciplinary staffings** for high-need cases at intake – including input from mental health professionals or school representatives – to decide the best course (this isn’t mandated statewide, but is a common practice in larger counties). Texas also has embraced **Family Engagement** at decision points: some counties invite families to case plan meetings even before the court hearing to ensure the family voice is heard in recommendations.

**Risk Assessment Tools:** The **Risk and Needs Assessment (RANA)** is standard in Texas juvenile probation departments ([[PDF] TJJD Risk and Needs Assessment Training - Texas.gov](https://www2.tjjd.texas.gov/statistics/2014_Data_Conference/RANA%20Instrument%20Training.pdf#:~:text=Texas,RANA)). This tool evaluates the likelihood of reoffending and identifies needs across domains (family, school, substance use, etc.). The **thresholds for diversion** often depend on the RANA results and offense severity: a low-risk score and a misdemeanor offense will almost always result in an offer of diversion (deferred prosecution) rather than court, per Texas probation guidelines. For detention decisions, Texas counties use a **Detention RAI** (many adopted a model from the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s JDAI initiative). High RAI score = likely detention; low score = release or non-secure alternative, unless overridden. Additionally, Texas uses specialized assessments in certain programs – e.g., the *Front-End Diversion Initiative (FEDI)* in some counties targets youth with mental health issues, using a mental health screening to divert them into treatment early ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=useful,or%20interfaces%20with%20a)). In summary, Texas employs *structured decision tools at multiple points*: RANA for whether to divert or what level of supervision, DRAI for detention, and various screening tools (MAYSI-2, trauma screen) to inform service referrals ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=useful,or%20interfaces%20with%20a)).

**Standardized Forms/Documentation:** Texas benefits from a **statewide information system called JCMS (Juvenile Case Management System)** that all counties use or share data with ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Texas%E2%80%99%20Diversion%20Investments%20and%20JCMS,a%20brief%20mental%20health%20screen)). At intake, the officer enters the referral details into JCMS, including fields such as *“Referral Source”*, *“Alleged Offense”*, *“Detention Risk Score”*, and *“Diversion Outcome”* ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=constitutes%20a%20%E2%80%9Creferral%E2%80%9D%2C%20what%20disposition,all%20who%20need%20to%20know%E2%80%8B)). The **intake form** and assessment results thus become part of a single electronic record. There are standardized forms for **Deferred Prosecution Agreement** (diversion contract) under the Texas Family Code, which list the conditions and must be signed by the youth, parent, prosecutor, and approved by a judge. If a case goes to court, the **petition format** and **predisposition report** format are also standardized. Texas requires a **Predisposition Report** (PDR) to be prepared by probation for the court, which includes the youth’s RANA risk level and recommendation for disposition. All of these documents are often generated out of JCMS to ensure consistency. In terms of **documentation of youth rights**, Texas has a form to record that a youth and parent were given Miranda warnings and *juvenile statements* (if any) were made voluntarily; however, intake interviews focusing on assessment are separate and used for placement decisions, not guilt determination.

**Youth Rights & Guardian Involvement:** In Texas, a parent or guardian must be promptly notified when a juvenile is taken into custody. At the detention hearing, youth have a right to appointed counsel. Uniquely, because 17-year-olds are not in juvenile court, Texas families *lose parental involvement rights at 17 in the justice process* ([[2021 Session] “Raise the Age”: Hold 17-Year-Olds Accountable in the Juvenile Justice System | Texas CJE](https://texascje.org/2021-session-raise-age-hold-17-year-olds-accountable-juvenile-justice-system#:~:text=In%20Texas%2C%2017,sense%20approach)), which advocacy groups cite as a reason to raise the age (parents are removed from the process once the child is in adult court). For those in the juvenile system (16 and under), Texas law expects parents to be involved in diversion agreements and probation. The parent/guardian signs the deferred prosecution or probation contract and is often ordered to participate in certain programs (like parenting classes or family counseling) as part of the disposition. **Educational continuity:** County juvenile departments coordinate with schools – for instance, if a youth is detained pre-trial, Texas regulations limit detention unless absolutely necessary, partly to avoid school disruption. If a youth is committed to TJJD (state facility), they are enrolled in the on-site accredited school (TJJD operates its own school district). Texas has also *pioneered “Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Programs (JJAEPs)”* for youth expelled from school ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=pioneered%20Juvenile%20Justice%20Alternative%20Education,is%20expelled%20may%20attend%20the)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L509%20pioneered%20Juvenile,is%20expelled%20may%20attend%20the)). In certain counties, if a youth is involved in serious misbehavior at school (often overlapping with delinquency), they attend a JJAEP which is a separate educational setting run in partnership with the juvenile justice system. This ensures the youth continues earning credits in an environment with additional supports and supervision. Upon reentry from a TJJD facility, Texas requires a **school re-enrollment plan**. Credits earned in custody transfer to the home school, and if a youth has special education needs, the home district must honor the IEP. Each TJJD facility has an education transition specialist to coordinate with the youth’s home school before release – an example of cross-system coordination to uphold educational rights.

**Digital Tools:** Texas’ **JCMS** is often highlighted as an exemplary data system ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Texas%E2%80%99%20Diversion%20Investments%20and%20JCMS,a%20brief%20mental%20health%20screen)). It links all 254 counties and the state-level TJJD, serving as a unified record for each youth. This greatly supports decision-making and coordination: for example, if a youth moves to a different county, their history and assessments are visible to the new jurisdiction. JCMS also has notification functionalities – e.g., when an intake is completed and if the youth is eligible for a particular diversion program, the system can flag it or send a notice to that program contact ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=consistency,forwarded%20to%20the%20prosecutor%E2%80%99s%20system)). Information sharing is facilitated so that **all stakeholders “who need to know” can access the case data in real time ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=consistency,forwarded%20to%20the%20prosecutor%E2%80%99s%20system))**. Texas has also invested in **automated reminders** (some counties send text or mail reminders for court dates to parents) to reduce failures to appear ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Many%20jurisdictions%20get%20a%20blanket,is%20overlooked%20by%20requiring%20those)). Another digital platform in use is TJJD’s **CAPS** (Caseworker Automation and Placement System) for committed youth, which interfaces with JCMS. Overall, Texas leverages technology to ensure data follows the youth and to implement structured decision rules. An example of decision support: JCMS can enforce data validation – if an intake officer tries to commit a misdemeanor youth to state custody, the system will not allow that disposition code because it’s against Texas law (thereby preventing errors). This kind of built-in logic helps align practice with policy.

### Louisiana
**Legal/Procedural Structure:** Louisiana’s juvenile justice system is characterized by a strong state-level role in custody and a mix of local and state roles in probation. Each judicial district in Louisiana has a juvenile court (or the district court acting as juvenile court) and an elected District Attorney who decides whether to file delinquency petitions. **Intake** in Louisiana can occur through two paths: (1) **Informal FINS (Families in Need of Services)** process for status offenses and very low-level matters, handled outside of court by social service entities; or (2) Delinquency intake for criminal offenses, usually handled by a **probation officer or intake officer** affiliated with either the local court or the state Office of Juvenile Justice (OJJ). In many parishes, the juvenile probation function (for non-committed youth) is run by local entities, but in others OJJ provides probation services by contract. When a youth is arrested, the **law enforcement officer** will either release to parents with a notice to appear or book the youth into a juvenile detention center if the offense is serious. Within 24 hours, a **detention hearing** before a judge occurs to decide if continued detention is warranted. Louisiana law, influenced by Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI) principles, requires an objective **Detention Risk Screening Instrument** to be used; several jurisdictions use a point-based RAI similar to Florida’s DRAI. If not detained, the youth may be placed under **home supervision** pending further action. The District Attorney’s office reviews the police report and can choose to **divert** certain cases pre-petition. Some jurisdictions have formal diversion programs (e.g., Jefferson Parish’s “Intervention Program” for first offenders). If diverted, the case might be referred to a **Families in Need of Services** unit or a community program with conditions like counseling, with no petition filed. If the DA files a **petition**, the case proceeds in juvenile court. Louisiana, since raising the age fully to 17 in 2020, now keeps most 17-year-olds in juvenile court for delinquency (only the most serious charges can still be transferred to adult court by judge’s order). At the **adjudication** stage, Louisiana judges often order a **Pre-Disposition Investigation (PDI)** report by a probation officer, which must include a **risk/needs assessment (commonly SAVRY)** score and recommendations ([[PDF] YOUTH SERVICES POLICY - Office of Juvenile Justice](https://ojj.la.gov/assets/docs/policies/community-based-services/D.11.1-Predisposition-Investigation-and-Social-History-09-21-22.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20YOUTH%20SERVICES%20POLICY%20,rating%20form%20SHALL%20NOT%20be)) ([Treating Youth in Residential Settings - Office of Juvenile Justice](https://ojj.la.gov/page/treating-youth-in-residential-settings#:~:text=Treating%20Youth%20in%20Residential%20Settings,may%20schedule%20a%20psychological)). The **disposition** options include probation (often under OJJ supervision if it’s a felony-level case) or commitment to state custody (OJJ). Louisiana has a **tiered custody system**: secure care facilities for the most serious, and non-secure residential or group homes for others. In recent years (especially post-2022), Louisiana has expanded alternatives like **evening reporting centers and short-term programs** to divert youth from deep-end placement ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=as%20a%20diversion%20from%20state,who%20don%E2%80%99t%20require%20secure%20custody)). For example, the Lafayette Parish Evening Reporting Center provides a 90-day intensive program as a disposition alternative to avoid commitment ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=as%20a%20diversion%20from%20state,who%20don%E2%80%99t%20require%20secure%20custody)). The state also instituted a **45-day secure diagnostic program** – a judge may send a youth to a secure center for 4-6 weeks evaluation, after which a recommendation is made to either return the youth on probation or commit them, introducing another decision point with expert input.

**Key Decision-Makers:** In Louisiana, the **District Attorney (prosecutor)** wields considerable influence at intake – they decide whether to prosecute or dismiss/divert a case. Law enforcement’s decisions (particularly in jurisdictions with law enforcement diversion programs or cite-and-release for juveniles) matter at the very front end, but by law all felony arrests must be referred to the DA. Once in the system, the **juvenile judge** is the central decision-maker for detention (detention hearing) and disposition. Louisiana judges rely on recommendations from **probation officers and multidisciplinary teams** (often including OJJ representatives) at disposition. The OJJ (state juvenile justice agency) itself has a voice: for example, OJJ policy requires that a SAVRY risk assessment be completed for every youth prior to disposition, and the **SAVRY “Summary Risk Rating” must be presented to the court in the PDI report** ([[PDF] YOUTH SERVICES POLICY - Office of Juvenile Justice](https://ojj.la.gov/assets/docs/policies/community-based-services/D.11.1-Predisposition-Investigation-and-Social-History-09-21-22.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20YOUTH%20SERVICES%20POLICY%20,rating%20form%20SHALL%20NOT%20be)). This effectively means the OJJ/Probation officer’s assessment score directly informs the judge’s decision. Another stakeholder is the **family**: Louisiana law (Ch. Code Art. 809) requires that the youth’s caretaker be notified of all proceedings and have an opportunity to be heard at disposition. Victims also have rights to give input, especially if restitution or community service affecting them is considered. Finally, because Louisiana has experienced DOJ oversight and reforms in the past, **external monitors and consultants** have indirectly influenced decision-making by establishing standards (for example, pushing for reduced detention overuse and more community-based services).

**Risk Assessment Tools:** Louisiana was an early adopter of the **SAVRY** (Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth) as a cornerstone of its decision-making. By OJJ policy, SAVRY is conducted on all youth adjudicated delinquent (and even on some pre-adjudication for informing plea agreements) ([[PDF] SAVRY - YOUTH SERVICES POLICY](https://ojj.la.gov/assets/docs/policies/community-based-services/D.10.32-SAVRY-Community-Based-Services-09-20-22.pdf#:~:text=Structured%20Assessment%20of%20Violence%20Risk,professionals%20in%20making%20judgments)) ([Treating Youth in Residential Settings - Office of Juvenile Justice](https://ojj.la.gov/page/treating-youth-in-residential-settings#:~:text=Treating%20Youth%20in%20Residential%20Settings,may%20schedule%20a%20psychological)). SAVRY assesses risk factors (historical, social/contextual, and individual) and protective factors to yield a risk level. Judges are provided the risk level; a *“low”* risk youth would generally be steered away from secure commitment in favor of probation or local programs, whereas *“high”* risk might justify a custodial placement if the offense is also severe. Louisiana does not yet use a formal disposition matrix statewide, but the **philosophy of using risk and offense severity to guide dispositions is ingrained** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,in%20community%20programs%2C%20and%20state)) ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=By%20weighing%20offense%20severity%20along,judicial%20circuits%20and%2067%20counties)). For detention decisions, many jurisdictions use a **Detention Assessment Instrument (DAI)** – often a point scale considering current offense, past offenses, and aggravating factors. The state encourages alternatives to detention (ATDs), and the RAI helps identify who can be safely released. Mental health screening is also standard – the **MAYSI-2** is administered at intake in detention centers and results are given to the judge at the detention hearing if there are acute concerns. Additionally, for longer-term planning, OJJ uses the **YLS/CMI (Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory)** for youth in custody to drive case plans, but SAVRY remains the primary intake tool.

**Standardized Forms/Documentation:** Louisiana’s OJJ maintains **“JETS” (Juvenile Electronic Tracking System)**, a centralized database for all youth under OJJ custody or supervision ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%20www2,system%20to%20a%20more%20user)). When a youth is adjudicated and placed on OJJ-supervised probation or committed to OJJ, their information is entered into JETS which tracks court dates, placements, incidents, etc. (Louisiana is in the process of modernizing JETS to a more user-friendly interface as of 2023 ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=supervision%20or%20custody%E2%80%8B%20ojj,Tennessee%20integrates%20juvenile)).) At the local level, **standard forms** include the **FINS intake form** (for informal cases), the **Delinquency petition** (handled by DAs), and the **PDI report template** used statewide which includes sections for SAVRY scores, social history, education, etc. Louisiana also employs a standardized **Case Plan document** for each youth in OJJ custody or supervision ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=plan%20documents%20that%20list%20the,Mental%20Health%2C%20Substance%20Abuse)). This individualized plan outlines responsibilities and services: what the agency will do (provide services X, Y, Z), what the youth will do (e.g., attend school, counseling), and what the family will do (participate in family therapy, ensure compliance) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=plan%20documents%20that%20list%20the,Mental%20Health%2C%20Substance%20Abuse)). All parties sign this plan. While this typically is completed after disposition, some parishes are starting to use a **“planning conference” at intake** if the youth is likely to be diverted – essentially creating a mini case plan even for diversion cases to document needs and services. Documentation of rights: Louisiana’s court rules have a form to verify that the youth and parents were advised of their rights (right to counsel, to remain silent, etc.) at the first appearance. If a youth is placed in detention or secure care, facilities must document provision of education and medical services – Louisiana underwent reforms that require better documentation of those services in JETS or facility logs.

**Youth Rights & Family Involvement:** Louisiana ensures counsel is appointed for indigent youth by the time of the detention hearing. The **parent or guardian’s presence** is required at all court hearings (failure of a parent to appear can even lead to contempt). For diversion cases, Louisiana’s approach (particularly via FINS) is very family-centric – often involving a conference with the family to address underlying issues (truancy, etc.) in lieu of court. **Guardian involvement** in formal cases is also critical: judges often address the parent in court to emphasize their role in supervision if the child is put on probation. At disposition, if a youth is ordered to OJJ custody, the family is consulted on the transition and must engage in regular family visits or therapy as part of the rehabilitation plan (if they do not, the court can be notified). **Educational continuity:** Louisiana places strong emphasis on reentry planning for schooling. OJJ operates schools in its secure facilities and coordinates with the State Department of Education to transfer records. Prior to a youth’s release, **OJJ case managers assemble an “education portfolio” with all current school records, credits, and any vocational certificates earned in placement ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L484%20case%20manager,receiving%20school%20to%20facilitate%20re))**. This portfolio is shared with the family and the receiving school to facilitate reenrollment ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L484%20case%20manager,receiving%20school%20to%20facilitate%20re)). Louisiana also has a statute that requires any agency providing education to incarcerated youth (state or local) to report data to the Department of Education, which monitors accountability and transition services ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L492%20,com)). This means there’s an interagency accountability for educational outcomes of justice-involved youth. If a youth has an IEP (special education plan), OJJ and local school boards must work together to continue services without interruption. Aftercare specialists in OJJ begin working on school placement for the youth about 30 days before release, often meeting with the school and family – a model of proactive educational advocacy.

**Digital Tools:** The **JETS system** is the backbone in Louisiana ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%20www2,system%20to%20a%20more%20user)). All major events in a case (intakes, risk assessments, court hearings, placements) are recorded. As of 2022-2023, Louisiana is actively **modernizing JETS** to improve data entry and reporting ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=supervision%20or%20custody%E2%80%8B%20ojj,Tennessee%20integrates%20juvenile)). The vision is a more user-friendly web-based platform that probation officers and facility staff can use seamlessly (the current system is older). Meanwhile, data from JETS is used to produce quarterly reports and even *dashboards* for administrators to spot trends (e.g., how many youth were diverted vs. petitioned in each parish). Another tool in use is a **risk assessment score integration**: Louisiana received technical assistance (through Models for Change) to integrate SAVRY scoring into their case management – for instance, the SAVRY domain scores auto-populate into the PDI report so that officers cannot omit that information ([[PDF] YOUTH SERVICES POLICY - Office of Juvenile Justice](https://ojj.la.gov/assets/docs/policies/community-based-services/D.11.1-Predisposition-Investigation-and-Social-History-09-21-22.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20YOUTH%20SERVICES%20POLICY%20,rating%20form%20SHALL%20NOT%20be)) ([Treating Youth in Residential Settings - Office of Juvenile Justice](https://ojj.la.gov/page/treating-youth-in-residential-settings#:~:text=Treating%20Youth%20in%20Residential%20Settings,may%20schedule%20a%20psychological)). This kind of integration ensures structured criteria directly inform decisions. For communication, Louisiana uses a system of **Alerts/Notifications** as well: when a youth in OJJ custody is coming up for release, an alert is sent to the education and reentry teams to start transition planning. Lastly, some jurisdictions (like Caddo Parish) have experimented with **e-referrals** – police can submit juvenile complaints electronically, which speeds up intake and allows probation to quickly decide on diversion before a youth ever sets foot in court. This digital referral process is being evaluated as a model to streamline early decision-making and possibly include an algorithm that flags low-level cases for automatic diversion (with human review).

### Missouri
**Legal/Procedural Structure:** Missouri’s juvenile justice system is often cited as an **innovative rehabilitative model**. Juvenile intake and probation are handled by Missouri’s circuit courts (each circuit has a Juvenile Division and juvenile officers), while state commitments go to the Missouri Division of Youth Services (DYS). The **“Missouri Model”** emphasizes keeping youth in small, therapeutic facilities rather than large youth prisons ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=survey%20and%20workflow%20design%3A%20The,of%20large%20detention%20centers%20and)), and this philosophy influences decisions at intake – there is a strong inclination to avoid secure detention or confinement unless absolutely necessary. When a youth is referred (either by law enforcement or school or parent complaint), the **juvenile officer (intake officer)** of the court conducts an initial inquiry. Missouri law and court rules allow juvenile officers to **informally adjust** a case without filing a petition if it’s in the youth’s and community’s best interest (similar to diversion). In practice, many first-time misdemeanors or status offenses are handled informally with the juvenile officer supervising a brief intervention (like referral to a class, community service, or just a warning letter). If the case is more serious, a petition is filed and the juvenile court judge becomes involved. For detention, Missouri uses a **standardized assessment** (the Juvenile Detention Assessment, modeled after JDAI) to decide if a youth should be held pre-trial. Detention must be authorized by a judge or juvenile officer based on criteria like seriousness and risk of flight. Missouri’s **disposition structure** has three levels: *Level A* (community supervision), *Level B* (moderate programs like group homes or local treatment), and *Level C* (commitment to DYS custody). DYS will only accept a commitment if certain criteria are met – generally that less restrictive alternatives have been tried or considered. By policy, **Missouri DYS only takes youth adjudicated for more serious offenses or those with chronic histories**. Indeed, Missouri’s DYS reports that the majority of youth in its custody are felony-level offenders (about 49% felonies, 37% misdemeanors, 14% status offenders) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=most%20serious%20or%20chronic%20cases%E2%80%8B,detention%20or%20probable%20cause%20hearing)) – indicating that lower-level cases are largely handled without commitment. This is partially due to the **Graduated Responses** approach: Missouri juvenile courts use graduated sanctions in the community for probation violators or minor reoffenses, rather than immediately removing the youth from home ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=diversion%20%E2%80%93%20for%20instance%2C%20a,gov)). Overall, Missouri’s workflow strives to keep youths in community settings whenever safe; even when committed, DYS often places youth in **small group home settings** or **day treatment centers** as opposed to large secure facilities, depending on their risk classification.

**Key Decision-Makers:** The **juvenile officer** in Missouri (a quasi-probation officer appointed by the court) is a powerful voice at intake and makes the initial call on diversion vs. petition. The **judge** must approve any detention and oversees adjudication and disposition. Missouri judges often rely heavily on **recommendations from DYS and the juvenile officer** at disposition. In many cases, a **staffing** is held with DYS representatives, the juvenile officer, the family, and sometimes the youth (especially if commitment is on the table) to discuss what level of intervention is needed. This team approach means the decision is informed by multiple perspectives. Another important “voice” is the **family** – Missouri’s model stresses family engagement. They often hold *family support team meetings* soon after a youth enters the system to involve the parents in planning ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,least%20a%20notes%20section%20to)). By the time of disposition, the family’s input and willingness to participate in services can influence whether a judge feels the youth can succeed on probation or needs to be removed. Missouri DYS also assigns every committed youth a **service coordinator** who essentially becomes an advocate/voice for that youth’s needs across the system and works with the family from day one. Victims have rights in Missouri as well – they can speak at disposition or submit impact statements, which might sway whether a judge chooses a stricter consequence or not.

**Risk Assessment Tools:** Missouri’s Juvenile Division historically used the **Missouri Juvenile Risk Assessment** instrument (an in-house tool) to classify a youth’s risk of reoffending. In recent years, some circuits have moved to validated tools like the **YLS/CMI (Youth Level of Service)**. Additionally, DYS conducts its own comprehensive assessment when a youth is committed: they are sent to a 30-45 day **intake assessment center** where psychologists and counselors assess the youth’s needs (including education level, mental health, etc.) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=center%20for%20about%2045%20days,to%2012%20weeks%20of%20core)). Based on this, DYS assigns a **classification level** for placement (ranging from community-based group home to secure care) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=juvenile%20system%20works%20hard%20to,The)). This classification acts like a post-disposition risk tier. At the front end, for detention decisions, Missouri uses a **Detention Screening Tool** with point values (factors like current offense type, prior failures to appear, etc.). If the score is below a cutoff, the juvenile officer must seek a non-secure alternative rather than detain. For diversion decisions, juvenile officers use informal criteria: generally first offense, low severity, and an assessment of youth remorse and family cooperation. Some circuits use the **OYAS (Ohio Youth Assessment System)** tools for diversion screening. Missouri’s emphasis on data-driven decisions is clear in DYS’s operations: they track outcomes meticulously and adjust. While not exactly a “threshold for diversion” formula, the culture is to divert when possible unless risk indicators show otherwise. For example, if a youth scores high on risk or has a serious felony, diversion is bypassed; otherwise, try diversion first. This aligns with Missouri’s guiding premise that **confinement is only for youth who pose a serious risk to public safety** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=making%3A%20having%20clear%20criteria%20or,youth%20to%20state%20facilities%20for)).

**Standardized Forms/Documentation:** Missouri uses a **uniform referral form** for when agencies (police, schools) refer a case to juvenile court. The **Missouri Juvenile Officer Handbook** provides templates for documentation such as *Informal Adjustment Agreements*, *Petitions*, and *Detention Hearing forms*. Diversion agreements in Missouri (often called Informal Adjustment) outline the obligations (similar to Arkansas’ approach) and are signed by the juvenile, guardian, and juvenile officer, then typically approved by a judge by administrative order. For formal cases, a **Social Study and Investigation Report** is prepared for dispositions, containing the youth’s history, assessment results, and recommendation. DYS has standardized **treatment plan forms** for committed youth, and those plans are shared with the court. In terms of data, Missouri’s courts and DYS share data through periodic reports – though not on a single IT system, they have collaborative data sharing. The Children’s Division (which oversees child welfare) and DYS have some linkage as well for youth who crossover. One notable practice: Missouri plans for reentry **at the time of intake into DYS**. A section of the initial DYS Individual Treatment Plan asks for “anticipated living situation upon release” and education/employment goals ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=DYS%E2%80%99s%20highly%20therapeutic%20programs,looking%20mindset)). This forward-looking documentation helps ensure continuity when the youth goes back home.

**Youth Rights & Family Involvement:** Youth in Missouri have right to counsel; Missouri also provides every youth committed to DYS with access to the **Child Advocate** or ombudsman if they have complaints about treatment. Family involvement is a cornerstone: from the start, Missouri tries to get family commitment. Parents are invited to treatment team meetings and *must* attend an orientation if their child is committed (DYS will transport them if needed). During probation, parents might be ordered to do counseling alongside the child. **Education:** Missouri’s approach to education for justice-involved youth is collaborative. If a youth is in detention or a residential facility, educational services are provided on-site by certified teachers (often via the local school district or DYS’s education program). They ensure that credits will transfer. DYS has a strong aftercare education program – each region has education staff that coordinate with local schools to reenroll kids coming out of custody. If a youth was expelled or cannot return to their old school, Missouri’s law allows creation of alternative education plans, including possibly attending a *Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Program* if available, or using the state’s virtual school to catch up on credits. Before a youth is released from a DYS facility, a *reentry conference* is held including education personnel to plan school placement. Additionally, if a youth in Missouri has an **IEP (special education plan)**, federal law (IDEA) applies – Missouri has been noted for doing a good job continuing special ed services seamlessly in DYS schools and then back in public school ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,last%20grade%20completed%2C%20any%20credit)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=deficiencies%2C%20special%20education%20needs%2C%20and,facility%20must%20provide%20the%20required)).

**Digital Tools:** Missouri does not have a singular statewide juvenile case management system like Texas, but DYS uses an internal system to track committed youth data (including education, treatment progress, etc.). The **courts use a case management system (JIS)** that includes juvenile cases, and some data from JIS is reported to the statewide court administration. Missouri also participates in the **Juvenile Interstate Data system** for interstate compact cases, but that’s a minor note. Innovative in Missouri is the use of **data dashboards and feedback loops**: for instance, DYS publishes annual outcome reports (recidivism rates, education outcomes) which in turn influence policymakers to keep funding community programs that show success. One could say Missouri’s “digital tool” is more about continuous quality improvement – e.g., analyzing how many youth were diverted in each circuit and sharing that with judges to encourage more diversion if reoffending remains low. In terms of decision support tech, Missouri could benefit from more automation; currently some places are looking at adopting an electronic screening tool for detention that auto-calculates the score when an officer inputs factors, to reduce subjective variance.

### Oklahoma
**Legal/Procedural Structure:** Oklahoma’s juvenile system is split between county-operated and state-operated components, with the Oklahoma Office of Juvenile Affairs (OJA) playing a central coordinating role. **Intake and probation** for most counties (particularly those without a separate juvenile bureau) are handled by OJA juvenile counselors. In Oklahoma’s two largest counties (Oklahoma and Tulsa), there are independent Juvenile Bureaus that handle local intake and detention. When a youth is arrested, law enforcement may either release the youth with a referral to appear at an intake interview or book the youth into a juvenile detention center if warranted. A **detention screening** is conducted using the state’s Detention Risk Assessment tool – only youth meeting certain criteria (serious offense or high risk score) should be detained. OJA policy requires that within 24 hours, a **detention hearing** is held before a judge or a designated detention screening officer to confirm the need for secure detention. For those not detained, an intake is scheduled with a **juvenile justice specialist** (probation officer). At **intake**, the specialist reviews the offense, meets the youth and family, and collects background information. Oklahoma employs a standardized form in this process (entered into the **JOLTS system**, described below) to capture all relevant data ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20a%20youth,match%20the%20case%20file%20exactly%E2%80%8B)). The intake officer can recommend: **(a)** no further action (case closed or warn and release for very minor issues), **(b)** diversion services (often called a “deferred filing agreement” where the youth agrees to certain conditions monitored by OJA for a few months), or **(c)** formal court processing (send the case to the District Attorney to file a petition). The District Attorney ultimately files the petition in serious cases, and the case goes to juvenile court. Similar to other states, a PDI report with risk assessment is done before disposition. Oklahoma’s **disposition options** include probation (usually under OJA supervision) or commitment to OJA custody for out-of-home placement. OJA operates several secure facilities and group homes, but also contracts with private providers for specialized placements. Notably, Oklahoma has **state-run group homes and regional detention centers** that act as intermediate sanctions – a youth can be placed in a group home instead of a locked facility if they don’t require maximum security ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Lafayette%20Parish%20Evening%20Reporting%20Center,who%20don%E2%80%99t%20require%20secure%20custody)). Since 2022, Oklahoma has been implementing Senate Bill 142 to broaden community-based alternatives and limit secure detention for low-level cases (reflecting ongoing reforms).

**Key Decision-Makers:** At the front end, **law enforcement** in Oklahoma can use “station adjustment” type diversions (informal handling) but often the decision falls to the **juvenile intake counselor** after referral. Intake counselors (OJA staff in most places) are key voices on diversion: their recommendation to the DA carries weight – many DAs will decline to file if intake recommends diversion and the family is cooperative. The **District Attorney** in Oklahoma’s juvenile cases decides which cases to petition and can insist on formal handling for serious offenses. Once petitioned, the **judge** or **special judge** (often a juvenile court referee) oversees detention hearings and adjudication. Disposition in Oklahoma is heavily influenced by the **OJA recommendations**. OJA typically convenes a **multi-disciplinary team (MDT)** staffing for any youth considered for custody, including the youth’s OJA counselor, a supervisor, perhaps a psychologist or program representative, and the family. This MDT gives input to a written recommendation to the court. Because OJA will be responsible for the youth if committed, judges usually heed OJA’s recommendation (e.g., if OJA says the youth can be managed on probation with services, the judge may opt for that; if OJA suggests a particular program, the judge knows a bed is available there). **Parents/guardians** have a voice via the intake process and any informal conference – in some counties, a judge will ask the parent in court if they are willing to supervise the youth and ensure they participate in programs; a positive parental involvement can tip toward a probation disposition. Victims in Oklahoma have rights to be notified and heard especially if the offense was violent; their stance could affect a prosecutor’s willingness to divert (for example, a victim strongly objecting might push the DA to file formally even if the youth is low-risk).

**Risk Assessment Tools:** Oklahoma uses a couple of structured tools. At detention, a **Detention Risk Assessment** is used statewide (point-based rubric). At intake and for disposition planning, OJA utilizes the **YLS/CMI (Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory)** as a risk/needs assessment for delinquent youth. This was adopted statewide as part of performance-based standards. The **YLS/CMI score** guides whether a youth is categorized low, moderate, or high risk to reoffend, which in turn influences recommendations: low-risk youth are steered toward diversion or minimal supervision, while high-risk might require intensive services or custody. Oklahoma also screens all youth for trauma and mental health needs (they have implemented a **Trauma Screening Questionnaire** and MAYSI-2 upon intake). **Thresholds for diversion:** Generally, if the YLS/CMI classifies a youth as low risk and the offense is a misdemeanor or non-violent felony, diversion is recommended. There is an unofficial policy in many districts that **first-time low-risk offenders get an opportunity for diversion**. Reassessment is also part of the protocol – if a youth is on probation, OJA will redo the YLS every 6 months to track progress and adjust the level of supervision. For those in OJA custody, there’s a **Level System** (separate from YLS) that determines movement towards release; this is based on behavior and treatment progress rather than risk, but the initial placement into a group home vs. secure facility is risk-guided.

**Standardized Forms/Documentation:** Oklahoma’s OJA uses a comprehensive electronic system called **JOLTS (Juvenile On-Line Tracking System)** for all case documentation from intake onward ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20a%20youth,match%20the%20case%20file%20exactly%E2%80%8B)). When a youth is brought to detention or intake, staff log into JOLTS and fill out an **electronic intake form** capturing the youth’s demographics, offense details, date/time of admission, guardian info, and any immediate alerts (suicidal ideation, medical needs, etc.) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20a%20youth,match%20the%20case%20file%20exactly%E2%80%8B)). They also input the **detention screening score** into JOLTS ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=of%20admission%2C%20who%20the%20guardian,match%20the%20case%20file%20exactly%E2%80%8B)). OJA monitors these entries for timeliness and accuracy – they require entries within 3 working days of any admission or release, and data in JOLTS must match the case file ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=the%20system%E2%80%8B%20www2,least%20export%20data%20in%20a)). This practice ensures a *single source of truth* for case data. Standard documents include the **Referral form** (law enforcement’s complaint), **Notice of Intake decision** (a form that goes to the DA stating intake’s recommendation), **Informal Adjustment Agreement** form (if diversion, outlining conditions), and if petitioned, the **Petition** and eventually a **Disposition Order** form. OJA also has a **Uniform Case Plan form** used for youth on probation or in custody, which is filed with the court. Key categories captured in JOLTS (and thus on forms/reports) are: juvenile profile info, referral source, alleged offense, prior history, **screening assessments results** (YLS risk level, MAYSI flags), decision (divert or file), services referred, and outcomes (successful completion of diversion, adjudication results, etc.) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=designed%20either%20to%20interface%20with,org)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=constitutes%20a%20%E2%80%9Creferral%E2%80%9D%2C%20what%20disposition,all%20who%20need%20to%20know%E2%80%8B)). This uniform data collection makes it easier to analyze decision points and equity across the state.

**Youth Rights & Guardian Involvement:** Oklahoma provides attorneys to youths who can’t afford one once a petition is filed, and interestingly, even if a youth is diverted, they often inform the family of the right to counsel before signing an informal agreement (to ensure it’s truly voluntary). Guardians are required to sign diversion agreements and are expected to participate in any family services. If a youth is held in detention, Oklahoma follows federal sight-and-sound separation rules and 6-hour limits for holds in adult jails ([Case Flow Diagram | Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/statistical-briefing-book/structure_process/case#:~:text=Federal%20regulations%20discourage%20holding%20juveniles,or%20sound%20of%20adult%20inmates)). **Educational continuity:** Education for detained youth in Oklahoma is provided by the local school district in the county-operated detention centers (e.g., Tulsa County Juvenile Detention Center has Tulsa Public Schools teachers on-site). For youth in OJA custody (in state group homes or institutions), OJA ensures they are enrolled in an accredited education program – often OJA runs its own school program at larger facilities, and group homes arrange enrollment in local public schools. Oklahoma law (HB 3215 from 2016) facilitated the sharing of educational records for system-involved youth to reduce delay in enrollment. At intake, Oklahoma’s forms include fields for **current school, grade, special education status** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L473%20importance%20of,that%20at%20the%20moment%20of)). OJA policy is that whenever a youth is placed in custody or detention, an education liaison requests their records from their home school within 48 hours ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L479%20have%20an,Louisiana%E2%80%99s%20OJJ%2C%20for%20example%2C%20has)). Upon release or probation, there’s coordination for re-enrollment. Oklahoma has also piloted some evening reporting centers that include tutoring, aiming to keep youth on track academically as part of diversion.

**Digital Tools:** The **JOLTS system** stands out as a long-standing juvenile justice database (Oklahoma was one of the first states with a statewide juvenile tracking system). It is somewhat legacy technology but has comprehensive data. OJA has been working on a new system (“JOLTS Next Generation”) to modernize the interface. Nonetheless, the concept of a unified data system in Oklahoma is a model many states emulate ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%20www2,system%20to%20a%20more%20user)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=modelsforchange,in%20one%20place%20%E2%80%93%20an)). JOLTS allows for **data sharing** with law enforcement and the courts. For instance, some police agencies can submit referrals electronically into JOLTS, and court dockets can auto-update case statuses. The system also ensures **data quality through enforcement of standards** – e.g., it uses standard definitions of referral reasons, disposition codes, etc., so that analysis is consistent ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=particularly%20useful%20and%20replicable%3A%20Common,the%20intake%20app%20ensures%20consistency)). In terms of decision support, Oklahoma is exploring adding a **“reminder/notification” feature** to JOLTS to notify the next stakeholder of needed action ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=consistency,forwarded%20to%20the%20prosecutor%E2%80%99s%20system)). For example, once an intake is completed and if a youth is diverted, JOLTS could automatically send a notice to the designated community program contact or schedule a review date and alert the officer when the diversion period is ending. Similarly, if a petition is filed, data from JOLTS can be electronically forwarded to the prosecutor’s case management system to avoid re-entry. These kinds of integrations streamline the workflow. Additionally, Oklahoma uses **automated alerts for warrants** – if a youth on probation absconds or doesn’t appear in court, JOLTS flags it and can generate a warrant request. Contact information of guardians in JOLTS is used to quickly reach out in such cases, highlighting the importance of keeping that data up to date ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20states%20like%20Missouri%20and,intake%20system%20should%20treat%20party)).

### Mississippi
**Legal/Procedural Structure:** Mississippi’s juvenile justice system is distinctive in that it operates through county-based **Youth Courts** (which in most counties are run by County Court judges, and in a few by Chancery Court judges). The Youth Courts have jurisdiction over delinquency and status offense matters. **Intake** in Mississippi is often handled by a **“Youth Court counselor”** (essentially a juvenile probation officer) who works under the direction of the Youth Court judge. Law enforcement referrals go to the Youth Court intake unit. Mississippi law permits considerable informality: Youth Court counselors can, with the judge’s approval, divert cases or resolve them through **“informal adjustment”** without a petition. In 2022, Mississippi reported 13,893 total intakes statewide, of which about **25% were diverted and 7% handled by informal adjustment agreements (without petition)** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=rather%20than%20being%20held,receives%20a%20full%20YASI)). This indicates a significant portion (around one-third) of youth never reach formal adjudication due to intake decisions favoring non-custodial paths. If an informal adjustment is used, the counselor, youth, and guardian agree to certain conditions (similar to other states’ diversion contracts) and typically the case is reviewed after 6 months; if all conditions (e.g., attend school regularly, obey curfew, maybe attend a workshop) are met, the case is closed. If the case is petitioned, it goes before the Youth Court judge (or referee). The judge also conducts **detention hearings** if a youth was detained. Mississippi has a statute requiring that detention be used only for specific serious situations (e.g. felony allegations or when a youth is a danger), and judges often *call on intake risk assessments* to guide this. The state encourages alternatives like **holdovers** (short-term shelter care) or releasing to parents with restrictions. At disposition, Mississippi’s Youth Court judges have the options of probation, **restitution or community service orders**, or commitment to the Mississippi Division of Youth Services (which runs the state training schools). Mississippi has **one remaining training school (Oakley Youth Development Center)** after closing others in recent reforms. Commitments to Oakley are now relatively rare – reserved for serious or chronic offenders. The data reflects this funnel: only about 5-10% of intakes might end in state custody. Mississippi law also provides for a **“continuum of care”** approach, meaning judges should use the least restrictive alternative first. Notably, Mississippi was one of the states involved in the MacArthur Models for Change initiative, which spurred improvements like standardized screening and more diversion. Since 2022, Mississippi has worked on bolstering its community-based services, including restorative justice programs, which has likely increased diversion rates.

**Key Decision-Makers:** The central figure in Mississippi is the **Youth Court Judge**, who often directly supervises the intake officers and has to approve diversion plans. In many counties, the Youth Court judge informally reviews each new referral with the counselor to decide if it should be diverted. This is a bit different from states where probation acts autonomously – in Mississippi, judges are very hands-on. The **intake counselor** (Youth Court counselor) is still key in gathering info and making a recommendation. The **prosecutor** (often an assistant DA or county prosecutor assigned to Youth Court) is involved primarily in formal petitions and may have input if a case involves a serious offense (e.g., the prosecutor might object to diversion for a violent felony). Ultimately, however, the Youth Court judge has discretion to allow an informal handling if deemed appropriate by statute. Another important voice is the **Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services (CPS)** for status offenders: status offense cases (incorrigibility, truancy) in Mississippi can be handled as “Children in Need of Supervision” and often involve CPS case plans rather than delinquency proceedings. So, a youth who is primarily a runaway or truant might have their case diverted to a CPS social worker’s care plan. At disposition for delinquency, the **Division of Youth Services (DYS)** provides recommendations via its community counselors. If a youth is a candidate for commitment, DYS will do an assessment and give input because they operate the facility. **Families** have to consent to informal adjustments; if a parent doesn’t agree and insists on a hearing, the case might go formal. Also, Mississippi’s system requires parental involvement – e.g., a parent may be ordered to participate in counseling alongside the child.

**Risk Assessment Tools:** Mississippi’s Division of Youth Services has adopted the **Youth Assessment and Screening Instrument (YASI)** as the primary risk/needs tool ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,within%203%20days%20of%20admission%E2%80%8B)). Every youth who is committed to Oakley Youth Development Center receives a full YASI assessment within 3 days of admission ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=custodial%20paths%20when%20possible,%E2%80%93%20Diversion%20vs%20Custody%3A%20The)). Moreover, **many counties administer a brief YASI screening earlier in the process to inform the Youth Court’s decisions** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=uses%20the%20Youth%20Assessment%20and,%E2%80%93%20Diversion%20vs%20Custody%3A%20The)). This means at intake, the counselor might do a YASI prescreen to gauge risk level. If the YASI prescreen indicates low risk and there’s no serious violent charge, it bolsters the case for diversion. Conversely, a high risk score might prompt the judge to lean toward formal handling and closer supervision. Mississippi also screens for mental health needs; they use instruments like MAYSI-2 or CAFAS in some jurisdictions especially if considering diverting to a mental health program. For detention, some Youth Courts use a detention screening tool (not uniformly statewide, but larger counties like Hinds and Rankin do). Generally, Mississippi’s threshold for sending a youth to the state training school (Oakley) is quite high now: typically the youth must have a felony adjudication and a history of prior interventions. The YASI risk level is considered – by DYS policy, low-risk youths are not appropriate for training school unless there’s an overriding circumstance (Mississippi aligns with the best practice of avoiding incarceration for low-risk youth) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,in%20community%20programs%2C%20and%20state)). YASI also helps shape *diversion plans* by identifying needs: for instance, if YASI flags family conflict and school issues, the informal adjustment agreement may include family counseling and tutoring. This structured approach to diversion is a newer development since 2020, showing a data-guided targeting of services.

**Standardized Forms/Documentation:** Mississippi’s Youth Courts each keep records, but under a recent initiative, they are feeding data into a statewide **Mississippi Youth Court Information Delivery System (MYCIDS)**. MYCIDS captures basic case info and outcomes, though it’s not as comprehensive as some systems like JCMS. Still, key forms are standardized: **Intake forms** used by Youth Court counselors, **Informal Adjustment Agreement** (detailing the terms of diversion) – which must be signed by the youth, parents, counselor, and approved by the judge. The agreement will cite the statute that allows informal adjustment and typically lasts up to 6 months. **Petition forms** follow a uniform format (with the DA’s office preparing them). At disposition, Mississippi requires a **Disposition Order form** that includes findings on why a particular disposition was chosen (especially if committing to custody, the judge must certify that community alternatives were considered and found insufficient). DYS has its **Risk Assessment and Placement Recommendation form** that they provide if they assess a youth for commitment. Mississippi also documents educational status on intake forms – the Youth Court counselor notes the youth’s school and attendance, because if truancy is involved, it might be handled as a status matter. As for **data documentation**, Mississippi’s state DYS publishes an annual report with aggregated data like the number of intakes, diversions, adjudications, etc., which is how we know the 2022 statistics ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=rather%20than%20being%20held,receives%20a%20full%20YASI)). On the ground, each Youth Court judge monitors their diversion success; some courts have started tracking outcomes (e.g., completion rates of informal adjustments) in MYCIDS.

**Youth Rights & Family Involvement:** Mississippi’s youth are represented by court-appointed counsel in formal proceedings (the state has public defenders for Youth Courts, though resource challenges exist). Parents are required by Youth Court law to attend hearings unless excused. For **informal adjustments**, both the youth and the parent/guardian must *in writing* agree to the terms, acknowledging that failure will result in possible petition. This ensures they understand rights (including the right to demand formal adjudication instead). Mississippi is one of the states where **parental accountability laws** exist too – a Youth Court judge can order a parent to participate in counseling or even impose fines if a parent’s willful disregard contributed to the delinquency (though this is rarely used). **Education continuity:** Mississippi law (Miss. Code §43-21-321) requires that any child in detention or placement continue to receive education. Detention centers in Mississippi have teachers, usually provided by the local school district or the state Dept. of Education, to keep youth on track. For committed youth at Oakley, there is an on-grounds school (accredited) that youth attend daily; credits earned transfer to their home school. One innovation: Mississippi DYS in partnership with the Department of Education ensures that youth leaving Oakley have a **full educational assessment and an individualized reentry plan for school**. They try to re-enroll the youth in school or a GED program prior to release. In addition, the Mississippi Department of Education has to approve the curriculum at Oakley and monitor it, ensuring quality. If a youth is on probation and struggles with school, Youth Courts sometimes assign a **“tracking officer”** or mentor to help the youth attend school regularly – a practice to keep the youth in community and in class rather than violating probation and removing them.

**Digital Tools:** As mentioned, **MYCIDS** is the primary digital system connecting Youth Courts. It’s not fully unified (some smaller courts may not use it fully), but it is improving data collection. DYS (state level) has its own system for committed youth, which includes YASI assessment data and case plans. Mississippi has begun integrating YASI into digital form – instead of paper, counselors enter responses into a YASI software that calculates the score. This helps in quickly sharing the youth’s risk level with the judge. Another digital aspect is **communication between systems**: Mississippi’s CPS and Youth Court systems can share data for youth who are involved in both (crossover youth). For example, if a youth is already in foster care and then gets a delinquency referral, the systems alert each other so the judge can handle the case appropriately (potentially as a dual-status case with a unified plan). This kind of data exchange ensures that a youth’s full context is considered at decision points. A best practice feature Mississippi is looking to adopt is an **electronic checklist** for intakes – requiring the counselor to input certain info (school status, mental health screen results, victim input) before closing an intake, to ensure no factor is overlooked. This could be implemented within MYCIDS or a parallel application, and it aligns with the idea that a custom intake app should not allow progression until all key fields (like guardian contact, etc.) are filled ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=guardians%20about%20upcoming%20court%20dates,form%20for%20them%20to%20sign)). Mississippi’s relatively smaller size (in terms of juvenile caseload) makes it feasible to closely monitor data quality and implement such decision support tools in the near future.

### Tennessee
**Legal/Procedural Structure:** Tennessee’s juvenile justice system is county-administered at the court level but has a unique twist: the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services (DCS) oversees both child welfare **and juvenile justice state commitments**, integrating those functions. **Intake** and diversion in Tennessee are largely handled at the county level by juvenile court staff (probation officers or youth services officers employed by the county juvenile court). Upon referral (via a delinquency petition usually filed by law enforcement or a private citizen’s complaint), a **juvenile court intake officer** reviews the case. Minor offenses can be dealt with by **pretrial diversion** (informal adjustment) per Tennessee law – often called “Informal Adjustment” or “Pretrial Diversion” in the statutes. The intake officer may hold a conference with the youth and family to impose conditions (like curfew, restitution, or referral to counseling) without involving the judge formally, if the family agrees. However, for any serious cases or if the youth denies the allegations, a formal petition moves forward to a **juvenile court judge** (or magistrate). At the detention stage, Tennessee requires a **detention hearing within 72 hours** if a youth is held. Detention risk screening tools are used in some jurisdictions (Davidson County, for example, uses one) but it is not mandated statewide; still, the predominant practice is to reserve detention for violent offenses or youth who cannot be controlled at home. The judge can also order a **“trial home placement”** with conditions as an alternative to secure detention. After adjudication, the disposition decision in Tennessee is between **probation (which can include a range of services)** or **commitment to DCS custody**. Tennessee law (Juvenile Reform Act of 2018) encouraged a continuum of responses and set criteria that **commitment to state custody should be primarily for felony offenses or for youth who have exhausted less-restrictive interventions**. Thus, like other states mentioned, Tennessee typically commits only the more serious or chronic cases ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=diversion%20%E2%80%93%20for%20instance%2C%20a,gov)). One distinctive element: Tennessee’s DCS operates a unified system called **TFACTS (Tennessee Family and Child Tracking System)** that holds records for both child welfare cases and delinquency cases ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=modelsforchange,in%20one%20place%20%E2%80%93%20an)). So if a youth has a history with child protective services and now has a delinquency, DCS can see both histories in one place. This integration underscores how many justice-involved youth have overlapping issues (abuse/neglect histories).

**Key Decision-Makers:** **Juvenile court judges** in Tennessee’s 98 juvenile courts are the pivotal decision-makers. They appoint intake officers and often set local policies for diversion. The **probation officers (juvenile services officers)** conduct the initial interviews and make recommendations to the judge or magistrate. Many counties use **interdisciplinary case reviews** – for example, Shelby County (Memphis) has a Juvenile Court Assessment team that meets on certain cases to advise on needs and referrals. **DCS** becomes a key player at disposition if commitment is considered: DCS counselors or court liaisons provide input on what placements or programs are available for the youth. Because DCS will take custody if committed, their assessment of the youth’s needs and risk influences the judge’s decision. **Families** are heavily involved in Tennessee’s model; drawing from child welfare practice, Tennessee often holds **Family Team Meetings** soon after a petition or finding, especially for kids at risk of placement ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,least%20a%20notes%20section%20to)). In those meetings (sometimes even before disposition), the family, youth, probation officer, DCS representative, and service providers sit together to develop a plan. The outcome (agreements on what each party will do) is reported to the judge and can shape the disposition. For instance, if the family and community providers come up with a solid safety plan and services, the judge may opt for probation instead of custody. Victim involvement is considered too – Tennessee has a Victims’ Rights statute for juvenile cases, so victims can be notified of hearings and give input, mainly affecting conditions like restitution or community service orders.

**Risk Assessment Tools:** Tennessee does not have a single mandated risk tool statewide for delinquency, but several jurisdictions have adopted evidence-based assessments. Shelby County, for example, implemented the **Youth Assessment and Screening Instrument (YASI)** in recent years for probation decisions (Tennessee was part of a federal project that brought YASI to some sites). Additionally, the **Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY)** was piloted in a DCS facility context. However, statewide, DCS in its juvenile justice facilities uses the **YLS/CMI** to reassess committed youth and plan treatment. At intake, many areas still rely on professional judgment with some structured guidance. The **threshold for diversion** in practice is usually first-time misdemeanor = diversion. Some urban courts have formal screening tools: Knox County uses a checklist to identify low-risk first offenders for diversion automatically. Under the Juvenile Justice Reform Act, Tennessee encouraged use of “validated risk and needs assessments” at key points, so we have seen increasing use since 2022. By policy, **no youth should be committed to DCS unless they pose a significant risk or have needs that cannot be met with local services** – effectively a risk principle. So if a risk tool (like YASI/YLS) indicates low or moderate risk and it’s not a violent crime, the judge is expected to consider alternatives. For detention decisions, Davidson County (Nashville) uses a **detention assessment** form that has reduced their detention population. It’s likely other big counties follow suit though it’s not uniform. **MAYSI-2** is used broadly in detention centers across TN to screen for suicide risk and mental health; if a youth scores high, it might weigh in favor of diversion to a mental health program.

**Standardized Forms/Documentation:** Each juvenile court in TN maintains its records, but DCS involvement means additional documentation. For example, if a youth is committed, DCS must produce a **“permanency plan”** similar to a foster care plan, outlining goals for the youth (education, therapy, etc.). Many courts have standardized **probation order forms** with conditions that must be followed. **Informal Adjustment Agreements** are documented in writing – Tennessee Code requires that an informal adjustment not exceed 90 days unless extended by court order, so typically these agreements last 3 months and are documented, then reviewed. If a youth is successful, the intake officer files a brief report to the court. In the case of formal disposition, Tennessee’s court orders for commitment must include language that “probation and community options have been attempted or were not appropriate” to justify state commitment (reinforcing the graduated approach). **TFACTS**, the integrated database, holds a lot of case info: if a youth is under DCS (committed), all their info from intake, court orders, assessments, and services are recorded there. DCS’s integration allows, for instance, a DCS case manager to upload the youth’s **Individual Education Plan (IEP)** or school records, or a **psychological evaluation report**, and have it accessible across the system ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=modelsforchange,in%20one%20place%20%E2%80%93%20an)). As for intake forms: larger jurisdictions like Shelby County use a structured intake questionnaire (covering family, school, prior history, substance use, etc.) – effectively a social history – that the intake officer completes and that informs both diversion planning and any later court report.

**Youth Rights & Family Involvement:** Tennessee ensures appointed counsel for juveniles who can’t afford one, and given the integration with DCS, there’s attention to *due process* if a youth is to be placed in state custody (since DCS custody can mean placement far from home, etc.). Parents are formally parties to the proceedings and receive copies of all petitions and orders. Tennessee law also allows (and encourages) **informal adjustment only with the consent of the youth and parent**, ensuring they know they can insist on formal court hearing if they prefer. **Family involvement** is a strong suit: DCS often leverages its experience in family engagement from child welfare. For example, if a youth is committed, a **Child and Family Team Meeting** convenes within 30 days to craft the permanency plan (including the goal, which could be reunification or even Independent Living for older youth). Families are invited and their commitments (like attending family therapy or visitations) are recorded. **Educational continuity:** Tennessee DCS has **Education Specialists** on staff whose job is to coordinate education for youth in custody ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L498%20,last%20grade%20completed%2C%20any%20credit)). Each committed youth gets an Individual Education Plan (in the general sense, not only special ed) to ensure credits will transfer and that the time in custody is not educationally wasted ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L498%20,last%20grade%20completed%2C%20any%20credit)). DCS has a rule that every credit or grade earned in a facility school must be documented in the youth’s education portfolio, and they proactively reach out to the home school to update records ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L484%20case%20manager,receiving%20school%20to%20facilitate%20re)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=case%20manager%20must%20assemble%20an,receiving%20school%20to%20facilitate%20re)). If a youth is behind in credits, DCS facilities offer credit recovery courses. If a youth has an IEP (special ed), the DCS Education Specialist makes sure the facility provides the required services and that when the youth returns to public school, there is a meeting to reinstate appropriate services ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,last%20grade%20completed%2C%20any%20credit)). Also, since juvenile records in TN are confidential, DCS ensures that when transmitting education records, it’s clear the student was in a “special school” but details of offense are not shared, to reduce stigma.

**Digital Tools:** The **TFACTS system** is a modern, case-management system that has modules for juvenile justice. A DCS case manager or probation aftercare officer can log in and see everything from the youth’s placement history to health records. This integration across child welfare and juvenile justice is somewhat unique and is very useful when a youth has a dual history (which is common). For instance, a DCS worker can see if the youth was ever in foster care or received counseling from a previous CPS-involved case, giving context to current behavior ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=justice%20tracking%20into%20its%20child,in%20one%20place%20%E2%80%93%20an)). For local juvenile courts, there isn’t one statewide system; some use commercial software. However, Tennessee does collect certain data statewide (via the TN Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges) to analyze trends. A move toward a statewide system has been discussed, inspired by states like Texas and Oklahoma. Another digital aspect: Tennessee has piloted **e-filing** for juvenile petitions in a couple of jurisdictions, meaning law enforcement can file referrals electronically and the info auto-populates in the court’s system, reducing delay and allowing quicker intake screening. In terms of coordination, because DCS staff have access to TFACTS, a probation officer in a DCS aftercare unit can update a youth’s progress notes which can then be seen by the placement facility staff – ensuring everyone is on the same page. Additionally, DCS sends **notifications** via TFACTS – for example, when a youth is approaching 17.5 years old in custody, the system reminds staff to begin transition planning (since 18 is aging out). These kinds of reminders and shared info are beneficial for case planning. Tennessee also stresses documentation of contacts: if a youth on probation is supposed to be visited weekly, some courts use a **mobile app for probation officers** to log visits in real time, which then uploads to the case record. This is the kind of tech innovation that could be expanded into a comprehensive intake and case management app statewide.

### Florida (Additional State Example)
**Legal/Procedural Structure:** Florida’s juvenile justice system is largely centralized under the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). Intake and probation are handled by state-employed **Juvenile Probation Officers (JPOs)**. Florida has a well-defined structure for each stage. When a youth is arrested or referred, they are typically brought to a regional **Juvenile Assessment Center (JAC)** or the local DJJ office for intake screening. Florida law emphasizes **pre-arrest diversion**: for many first-time misdemeanors, law enforcement can issue a **civil citation** instead of an arrest ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=Image%3A%20civil%20citation%20image%20)). This civil citation program (or similar “Prearrest Delinquency Diversion”) allows the youth to complete community service or interventions without getting an arrest record. If police do arrest or refer to DJJ, the **JPO (intake probation officer)** conducts the **intake process** which includes an assessment of the youth’s risks and needs ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=An%20,collected%20through%20interviews%2C%20observations%20and)). A key aspect is the **Community Assessment Tool (CAT)** – a structured risk/needs assessment that replaced the old PACT tool ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=,used%20to%20help%20my%20child)). The JPO administers a CAT Pre-Screen to all youth referred to DJJ ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=The%C2%A0Community%20Assessment%20Tool%20,offend%20on%20the%20CAT)), which takes ~20-25 minutes and yields an initial risk level. If the youth scores Moderate-High or High risk to reoffend on the prescreen, a more detailed **CAT Full Assessment** is done ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=Pre,YES%29%20Plan)). Using all the gathered information (offense details, prior history, CAT results, interviews with youth and family, input from victims or school), the JPO then makes a **recommendation to the State Attorney (prosecutor)** ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=assessment%20information%20is%20collected%20through,the%20community%20as%20a%20whole)). The recommendation could be for **diversion** (non-judicial handling) or for formal court action. The State Attorney ultimately decides whether to file a petition. Florida has a wide array of diversion programs – e.g., Juvenile Arbitration, Teen Court, mentoring programs, etc. If diverted, the JPO formalizes a **Youth Empowered Success (YES) Plan**, which is a case plan listing goals and actions for the youth and family, derived from the CAT assessment ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=Pre,YES%29%20Plan)) ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=,Plan)). If the case goes to court, the first hearing is often a **detention hearing** to determine if the youth should be held in secure detention pending the case. Florida uses a statewide **Detention Risk Assessment Instrument (DRAI)** to score each case and make detention decisions ([Juvenile Detention Risk Assessment - The Annie E. Casey Foundation](https://www.aecf.org/resources/a-practice-guide-to-juvenile-detention-reform-1#:~:text=Juvenile%20Detention%20Risk%20Assessment%20,related%20risks)). The DRAI score falls into categories: release to parent, home detention (supervised release), or secure detention, and judges generally follow it unless there are overrides. At disposition (if the youth is adjudicated), Florida uses a **Disposition Matrix** (structured decision-making grid) that considers the offense severity and CAT risk level to guide whether the recommendation should be probation, a non-residential program, or residential commitment ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=match%20at%20L395%20By%20weighing,Instead%2C%20the%20hope%20is%20to)) ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=By%20weighing%20offense%20severity%20along,Instead%2C%20the%20hope%20is%20to)). Florida law and DJJ policy strongly favor keeping low-risk youth out of residential commitment – *“under no circumstances” should a low-risk youth be committed to residential placement without administrative approval in DJJ ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=Department%E2%80%99s%20recommendation%20should%20deviate%20from,for%20Probation%20or%20for%20Residential)) ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=Department%E2%80%99s%20recommendation%20should%20deviate%20from,even%20the%20most%20severe%20offenses))*. In practice, most youth are placed on probation in the community with a YES Plan of services; only higher-risk or felony cases go to one of DJJ’s residential programs (which range from staff-secure group homes to maximum-risk facilities). Florida also has an option of **“minimum-risk commitment”**, which is essentially intensive probation (the youth remains at home but is technically in DJJ custody) for moderate cases.

**Key Decision-Makers:** **Law enforcement officers** in Florida are key at the initial decision point due to the **Civil Citation** program – their choice to issue a civil citation or arrest determines whether the youth even enters the system formally. Many police agencies have citation quotas or targets to ensure eligible kids get diversion. Next, the **JPO (intake probation officer)** is critical; they gather all info and frame the recommendation. The **State Attorney** (prosecutor) is the gatekeeper for court: they can file the case in juvenile court or may choose to not file (nolle prosequi) and allow diversion. In some circuits, prosecutors run their own diversion programs for certain offenses (like a “Balanced and Restorative Justice” program). However, DJJ’s recommendation holds weight because the State Attorney knows the JPO has done an assessment and has expertise in youth placement. Once in court, the **judge** makes detention decisions (guided by DRAI) and disposition. Florida judges often adhere to DJJ’s recommendations at disposition about the appropriate level of placement. If a judge wants to depart from the Disposition Matrix recommendation (e.g., commit a youth when the matrix says probation), they must state reasons. Another crucial voice: **the victim**. Florida’s system, especially in diversion or in predisposition, considers victim input – for instance, if a victim agrees to a restitution or community service agreement, a case is more likely to be diverted. Florida also encourages **victim-offender mediation and conferencing** in certain diversion programs, giving victims a direct voice. **Parents/guardians** are involved through the YES Plan process – the JPO must involve the family in developing the plan of action for the youth ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=enforcement%20or%20the%20clerk%20of,and%20other%20individuals%20and%20agencies)) ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=the%20complainant%2C%20the%20victim%2C%20school,the%20community%20as%20a%20whole)). If a parent is unwilling to engage, the JPO notes that and it could influence whether diversion is viable or not.

**Risk Assessment Tools:** Florida’s **Community Assessment Tool (CAT)** is an actuarial risk/needs instrument specifically adapted for Florida (it’s basically a modified Youth Assessment and Screening Instrument). It assesses risk of reoffending and a host of needs/protective factors across domains. The CAT assigns youth a risk level: Low, Moderate, Moderate-High, or High. This risk level, combined with offense severity, feeds into the **Disposition Matrix** ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=By%20weighing%20offense%20severity%20along,Instead%2C%20the%20hope%20is%20to)). Florida’s Disposition Matrix (a structured decision tool implemented statewide around 2019) (continued)**Risk Assessment Tools (Florida):** As noted, the **CAT Pre-Screen** is given to all referred youth ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=The%C2%A0Community%20Assessment%20Tool%20,can%20be%20used%20to%20develop)). If a youth scores Moderate-High or High risk on that, the **CAT Full Assessment** is administered to dig deeper into needs ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=abuse%20assessment,YES%29%20Plan)). The CAT not only produces a risk to reoffend rating, but also identifies needs across domains (mental health, family, peers, school) and protective factors ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=the%20Youth%20Empowered%20Success%20,Plan)). Those results directly shape the youth’s YES Plan. Florida also has specialized assessments: a **Mental Health/Substance Abuse Screening** (often the MAYSI-2 or an equivalent) at intake to flag immediate intervention needs ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=Pre,YES%29%20Plan)). And unique to detention decisions, the **Detention Risk Assessment Instrument (DRAI)** is used statewide to objectively determine if a youth should be held in secure detention pending court ([Juvenile Detention Risk Assessment - The Annie E. Casey Foundation](https://www.aecf.org/resources/a-practice-guide-to-juvenile-detention-reform-1#:~:text=Juvenile%20Detention%20Risk%20Assessment%20,related%20risks)). The DRAI looks at the current offense, prior history, and other factors to assign a score; depending on the score, the youth may be released, placed on non-secure/home detention, or held in secure detention. Overrides are allowed but must be justified. By policy, only youth who score above a certain threshold (or meet statutory criteria like use of a firearm) can be detained. **Thresholds for diversion** are generally: first-time misdemeanors are eligible for civil citation (pre-arrest diversion) – indeed Florida expanded the civil citation to as many as 2-3 chances in some jurisdictions. For referred cases, a common threshold is that if the offense is not person-on-person violent and the youth has minimal or no priors, the State Attorney will concur with a JPO recommendation for diversion. If a youth is high-risk per CAT and commits a serious offense, formal petition is almost certain. At disposition, Florida’s **Disposition Matrix** (an internal DJJ tool supported by research) provides a recommended disposition level for each combination of offense severity and risk level ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=By%20weighing%20offense%20severity%20along,Instead%2C%20the%20hope%20is%20to)). For example, a moderate-risk youth with a third-degree felony might be recommended for probation or a non-residential program, whereas a high-risk youth with a first-degree felony would be recommended for residential commitment ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=match%20at%20L395%20By%20weighing,Instead%2C%20the%20hope%20is%20to)) ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=By%20weighing%20offense%20severity%20along,judicial%20circuits%20and%2067%20counties)). This guides JPOs in making disposition recommendations and promotes consistency across the state. Crucially, DJJ policy states that **low-risk youth should not be placed in residential commitment absent extraordinary circumstances** ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=Department%E2%80%99s%20recommendation%20should%20deviate%20from,for%20Probation%20or%20for%20Residential)) ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=Department%E2%80%99s%20recommendation%20should%20deviate%20from,even%20the%20most%20severe%20offenses)) – a safeguard similar to Arkansas’ and Texas’ policies, to avoid net-widening.

**Standardized Forms/Documentation:** Florida has a very structured documentation process. The **“Detention Risk Assessment Instrument” (DRAI) form** is uniform statewide – the JPO completes it upon intake (often electronically) and provides it to the judge at the detention hearing ([Juvenile Detention Risk Assessment - The Annie E. Casey Foundation](https://www.aecf.org/resources/a-practice-guide-to-juvenile-detention-reform-1#:~:text=Juvenile%20Detention%20Risk%20Assessment%20,related%20risks)). The **YES Plan** is a standardized case plan document that lists the youth’s goals, action steps, and required services, along with responsibilities of the youth, parent, JPO, and any providers. It’s essentially a contract for probation but is also used in diversion cases as a plan for the youth to complete during the diversion period ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=,Plan)) ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=enforcement%20or%20the%20clerk%20of,and%20other%20individuals%20and%20agencies)). All YES Plans and reports are entered into Florida’s **Juvenile Justice Information System (JJIS)**, which is the statewide integrated database. JJIS tracks every youth from intake through completion and is used by all components of DJJ (detention centers, probation, residential programs). Florida employs **Data Integrity Officers** to ensure information entered into JJIS is accurate and timely ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=Data%20Integrity%20Officers%20ensure%20that,is%20accurate%20throughout%20the%20Department)). The intake JPO’s assessment results (CAT scores, etc.) are recorded in JJIS and become part of the youth’s record. If the case goes to court, the JPO will prepare a **Pre-Disposition Report (PDR)** for the judge, summarizing the youth’s background, CAT assessment results, and a suggested disposition. This PDR is a standard template across Florida. Another standardized element: the **“Risk Assessment for Placement”** that residential facilities use to classify incoming youth is the same across all DJJ facilities, allowing consistent levels of supervision. Florida also carefully documents **youth rights** – e.g., there’s a form to record that the youth and guardian were informed of the right to counsel and against self-incrimination during DJJ interviews (though the actual CAT interview is considered non-custodial, so Miranda is usually not required as it’s for assessment not interrogation).

**Youth Rights & Guardian Involvement:** By Florida Rule of Juvenile Procedure, every child must have counsel at their first court appearance (in practice, public defenders are present at detention hearings). Parents/guardians are notified and encouraged to attend all hearings. During the **intake interview**, the JPO contacts the parent to schedule and conducts the interview typically with the parent present or by phone – gathering family and school information ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=enforcement%20or%20the%20clerk%20of,and%20other%20individuals%20and%20agencies)). The guardian’s perspectives are considered in the assessment and planning. For example, a parent might indicate that they are unable to control the youth at home; this could influence the decision to petition and seek services. Conversely, a supportive parent who is willing to engage in family counseling strengthens the case for diversion or probation. Parents also sign the YES Plan, indicating their agreement with their role in it. **Educational continuity:** Florida’s DJJ has a statutory mandate to provide education to all youth in its custody. Detention centers and residential commitment programs all have on-site schools (often run by the local school district or a contracted education provider) where youth attend classes year-round. The JPO collects the youth’s school records at intake (grade, any special education status) ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=enforcement%20or%20the%20clerk%20of,and%20other%20individuals%20and%20agencies)) and includes that in the referral packet. If a youth is diverted, often one condition is that they must attend school regularly (and the JPO checks on school attendance). If placed on probation, the YES Plan will almost always include an education goal (e.g., “Youth will earn at least C grades and have no unexcused absences”). Florida law also provides for **alternative education** if needed; for example, some counties have evening reporting centers that include academic tutoring as part of probation. When a youth is committed to a program, DJJ coordinates with the local school district to transfer transcripts and then back again upon release. Florida’s emphasis on this is evident in their data reports — they track the educational outcomes of youth in the system as a performance metric.

**Digital Tools:** Florida’s **Juvenile Justice Information System (JJIS)** is one of the most robust juvenile justice data systems in the country. All stakeholders within DJJ (detention staff, JPOs, residential program staff) input information into JJIS, enabling real-time sharing. For example, when a youth is admitted to a detention center, the intake forms and RAI scores entered by the JPO are visible to the detention center staff, who then add any incident reports or updates ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20a%20youth,match%20the%20case%20file%20exactly%E2%80%8B)). Data integrity officers ensure consistency, which is crucial for decision support — it means risk scores, prior history, etc., are reliably available whenever a decision point comes. **Notifications and workflow automation** are part of JJIS: if a youth is due for a 30-day detention review hearing, the system alerts the JPO and generates a report. Florida also has **dashboards and reports** (the civil citation dashboard, Detention utilization dashboard) accessible to the public and stakeholders, which promote transparency ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=Image%3A%20civil%20citation%20image%20)). In terms of decision support apps, Florida’s use of the CAT and Matrix is highly instructive. DJJ built an interface (called CAT Dashboard) that helps JPOs see which needs are highest for a youth and suggests available services. Moreover, the **Disposition Matrix is embedded in the computerized system** – when a PDR is written, the system will flag if the recommendation does not align with the Matrix (e.g., recommending commitment for a low-risk youth) prompting supervisors to review and justify any departure ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=Department%E2%80%99s%20recommendation%20should%20deviate%20from,even%20the%20most%20severe%20offenses)). This is very much like having a decision-support rule built into software, ensuring evidence-based practice. Florida’s **“Redirection” program (community-based alternative to commitment)** and other interventions are tracked in JJIS, and outcomes (like recidivism rates) are fed back to improve decision-making. Lastly, Florida uses technology for **appointments and reminders**: many probation offices use automated call or text systems to remind families of court dates or treatment appointments, reducing no-shows. All of these digital practices – common data standards, integrated information, and real-time alerts – exemplify how tech can support effective juvenile justice workflows ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=particularly%20useful%20and%20replicable%3A%20Common,the%20intake%20app%20ensures%20consistency)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=consistency,forwarded%20to%20the%20prosecutor%E2%80%99s%20system)).

### Innovative Models and Best Practices for Decision Support
Across these jurisdictions, several **exemplary models** emerge that can inform the development of decision-support tools and apps for juvenile justice stakeholders:

- **Structured Decision-Making Matrices:** States like **Florida** (Disposition Matrix) and **Georgia** (which implemented a Disposition Matrix in 2022 alongside its risk assessment) use structured grids that match offense severity and risk level to recommended outcomes ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=By%20weighing%20offense%20severity%20along,Instead%2C%20the%20hope%20is%20to)) ([](https://djj.georgia.gov/document/document/jj-system-flow-chart-2022pdf/download#:~:text=Released%20Pre,Assessment%20Screening%20Placement%20at%20Home)). These matrices promote consistency and limit subjective bias. A decision-support app can incorporate such matrices – e.g., after inputting offense and risk score, the app can display the presumptive disposition (and alert if a user selects an option that deviates, requiring justification). This ensures frontline decisions align with evidence-based guidelines, such as *not committing low-risk youth to custody* ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=Department%E2%80%99s%20recommendation%20should%20deviate%20from,even%20the%20most%20severe%20offenses)).

- **Risk Assessment Integration:** All states reviewed emphasize **validated risk/needs assessments (YASI, SAVRY, YLS, CAT, RANA, etc.)** at intake or disposition. An innovative practice is seen in **Arkansas and Texas**, where policy or law forbids committing low-risk youth to state custody ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=release%20,Instead%2C%20it)) ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=Department%E2%80%99s%20recommendation%20should%20deviate%20from,even%20the%20most%20severe%20offenses)). A decision-support app can mirror this by using business rules – for instance, if a youth’s risk score is “Low” and a user tries to select “State Commitment,” the app can flag or prevent it without supervisor override ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%20humanservices,helps%20operationalize%20the%20legal%20framework)). **Louisiana’s integration of SAVRY into court reports** is another model ([[PDF] YOUTH SERVICES POLICY - Office of Juvenile Justice](https://ojj.la.gov/assets/docs/policies/community-based-services/D.11.1-Predisposition-Investigation-and-Social-History-09-21-22.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20YOUTH%20SERVICES%20POLICY%20,rating%20form%20SHALL%20NOT%20be)); a tool can auto-populate risk factors into a report or dashboard for the judge, ensuring that risk level is front-and-center in decisions.

- **Comprehensive Case Management Systems:** Systems like **Texas’ JCMS** and **Oklahoma’s JOLTS** demonstrate the power of a single, unified database ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Texas%E2%80%99%20Diversion%20Investments%20and%20JCMS,a%20brief%20mental%20health%20screen)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20when%20a%20youth,match%20the%20case%20file%20exactly%E2%80%8B)). They enforce common data definitions (for offenses, outcomes, etc.) and enable instant information sharing among stakeholders. Any new decision-support app should be designed either to interface with such systems or at least export data in compatible formats to avoid duplicate data entry. For example, fields like *Referral Source, Alleged Offense, Risk Score, Diversion Decision* etc. can be entered once and used by all ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=constitutes%20a%20%E2%80%9Creferral%E2%80%9D%2C%20what%20disposition,all%20who%20need%20to%20know%E2%80%8B)). **Oklahoma’s JOLTS** even monitors data entry timelines, which is a best practice for data quality ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=the%20system%E2%80%8B%20www2,least%20export%20data%20in%20a)). The lesson is that technology should serve as the *single source of truth* for a case, and an app should reinforce that by pulling and pushing data to central repositories.

- **Automated Notifications and Workflow Triggers:** Several states have implemented or piloted automation to keep cases on track. **JCMS in Texas** can send notifications to the next responsible party when a step is completed ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=consistency,forwarded%20to%20the%20prosecutor%E2%80%99s%20system)). For instance, once an intake is finished in the app and a diversion assigned, the app could automatically email the referral details to the selected diversion program and set a reminder for the probation officer to check progress in 30 days. Similarly, **Tennessee’s TFACTS** reminds workers of upcoming transition plans ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20states%20like%20Missouri%20and,intake%20system%20should%20treat%20party)). A decision-support tool should include a **calendaring and alert system** – e.g., flag when a youth’s diversion period is ending, when a detention hearing deadline is nearing, or if a requirement (like a victim notification or school record request) hasn’t been completed within the expected timeframe.

- **Family and Victim Engagement Features:** Innovative practices like **Tennessee’s Family Team Meetings** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,least%20a%20notes%20section%20to)) or **Balanced and Restorative Justice (BARJ) programs** involve multiple voices in decision-making. A supportive tool could have a module to document these meetings and the agreed-upon actions for each stakeholder. It might prompt users to record whether a **guardian has been contacted and their stance** (consent to diversion, concerns, etc.), and whether the **victim has been consulted** for input on restitution or apology ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=Victim%20or%20Community%20Representative%3A%20In,the%20juvenile%20officer%20or%20clerk%E2%80%8B)). Involving these voices early can guide more tailored decisions. For example, if a victim is open to mediation, the app could suggest a restorative justice diversion path. **Arkansas’s requirement** that upon case closure (diversion completion or discharge from custody) the youth and guardian receive written notice ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=structured%20needs%2Fservices%20inventory%20becomes%20the,available%20in%20the%20system%20is)) is a good model – a system can auto-generate these closure letters using stored contact info. Ensuring the app cannot close a case file until, say, a guardian’s address is verified, would support this communication goal.

- **Small Rehabilitative Facility Model (“Missouri Model”):** While more of an operational philosophy than a tech feature, Missouri’s approach of using **small, therapeutic facilities and focusing on reentry from day one** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=survey%20and%20workflow%20design%3A%20The,of%20large%20detention%20centers%20and)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=DYS%E2%80%99s%20highly%20therapeutic%20programs,looking%20mindset)) is a best practice. A decision-support app can reinforce that philosophy by including a **“Reentry Planning” component at intake for any out-of-home placement**. For instance, as soon as a disposition of commitment is chosen, the app could prompt the user: “Enter anticipated living situation upon release and any reentry needs.” Missouri does this manually; embedding it in software ensures planning for reentry isn’t overlooked even at the start of a case ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=tree%20or%20field%20for%20%E2%80%9CRecommended,looking%20mindset)).

- **Education Continuity Tracking:** Many states – Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, etc. – highlighted the importance of uninterrupted education and smooth records transfer ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=highlight%20how%20educational%20planning%20is,%E2%80%9Cmust%20provide)) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L484%20case%20manager,receiving%20school%20to%20facilitate%20re)). An exemplary practice is having an **education liaison quickly obtain and share school records** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L479%20have%20an,Louisiana%E2%80%99s%20OJJ%2C%20for%20example%2C%20has)). A case management app can facilitate this by having dedicated fields for school info (last school attended, grade level, special ed status) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L473%20importance%20of,that%20at%20the%20moment%20of)) and perhaps generating a standard **“Education Records Request” form to send to the school within 48 hours** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L479%20have%20an,Louisiana%E2%80%99s%20OJJ%2C%20for%20example%2C%20has)). It could also maintain an education portfolio (upload section for report cards, IEPs, etc.) accessible to whoever needs it (probation, facility, reentry worker). **Tennessee’s practice of ensuring credits transfer and creating an Individual Education Plan for each committed youth** ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=match%20at%20L498%20,last%20grade%20completed%2C%20any%20credit)) suggests an app could have a checklist for discharge that isn’t complete until an education transition meeting is documented.

- **Trauma-Informed Screening and Services:** Several states now do trauma screening at intake (Texas and others noted this) ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=diversion%20program%20in%20some%20counties%2C,thinking)). A forward-thinking tool would integrate a brief trauma questionnaire or at least a flagging system. For instance, if a youth indicates a history of abuse, the app flags “Consider referral to trauma-focused therapy” and ensures that need is captured in the case plan. This aligns with the growing trend of trauma-informed decision-making – identifying needs that, if addressed, can reduce recidivism. The app’s logic could, for example, link certain assessment answers to suggested services (akin to how Florida’s CAT links to the YES Plan services) ([Intake Process](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/faqs/probation-community-intervention/intake-process#:~:text=Pre,YES%29%20Plan)).

- **Data-Driven Accountability and Feedback:** An innovative model beyond individual case handling is using aggregate data to improve decisions. **New Jersey’s statewide detention reform (through JDAI) and Pennsylvania’s use of a Statewide Juvenile Case Outcomes Review** are examples where data on decisions (who was detained, who was diverted, outcomes by race, etc.) are analyzed and fed back to practitioners to adjust practice. A modern decision-support platform could include **analytics dashboards** for managers – for example, showing the diversion rate, success rates, and any disproportionate outcomes by race or gender. This can highlight biases or training needs. If an officer sees that their circuit diverts only 20% of eligible cases whereas the state average is 40%, they might examine their criteria. Essentially, building **business intelligence** into the system makes it not just a one-case tool but a continuous improvement tool for the whole jurisdiction.

In conclusion, while each state has its own statutes and procedures, the comparative analysis reveals common themes: an emphasis on **early risk screening, diversion whenever safe, involvement of family and victims, and data-informed decision criteria** to guide the youth towards the least restrictive, most constructive outcome. By learning from exemplary models – like Florida’s integrated assessment and planning process, Texas and Oklahoma’s unified data systems, Arkansas and others’ legal mandates on using risk levels, Missouri and Tennessee’s holistic family-focused approach, and Louisiana’s investment in structured assessments – we can design decision-support applications that **empower stakeholders** at every juncture. Such tools would ensure that no key factor (risk score, mental health need, victim input, educational requirement) is overlooked, that decisions are consistent and fair, and that all “voices” in the youth’s life are heard and recorded. Ultimately, leveraging these best practices in technology will help achieve the goal of an evidence-based, youth-centered juvenile justice workflow that maximizes diversion and rehabilitation while safeguarding community safety ([full-research.txt](file://file-AXNff277E4L7hYPbPstRKJ#:~:text=,Program%20Durations%20and%20Treatment%20Timeframes)) ([Structured Decision-Making and the Disposition Matrix | Florida Department of Juvenile Justice](https://www.djj.state.fl.us/research/structured-decision-making-and-the-disposition-matrix#:~:text=jeopardize%20public%20safety%3B%20,will%20receive%20similar%20disposition%20recommendations)). The result is a smarter system where each youth’s pathway is determined by structured, well-informed choices rather than ad hoc judgments – a system that supports youths in getting the help they need and supports decision-makers in getting it right.
