Juvenile Justice Intake, Diversion, and Custody Pathways in Arkansas and Neighboring States
Legal Frameworks and Required Intake Forms
Arkansas: Arkansas law lays out a clear framework for juvenile intake and diversion. State statute mandates that intake officers use validated risk assessment tools to inform decisions (per Act 189 of 2019)​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. In practice, after a youth is arrested or cited, a conference is held with a juvenile intake officer, the youth, and their parent/guardian to discuss the complaint​
bobbydigbylaw.com
. If appropriate, and with consent of the juvenile and parent, the intake officer may divert the case without formal court petition​
washingtoncountyar.gov
. Arkansas Code §9-27-323 requires that any diversion agreement be documented in writing, name the attorney (or advisor) for the juvenile, and be signed by all parties (including the prosecutor for serious offenses)​
codes.findlaw.com
. Copies of the signed diversion agreement must be provided to the juvenile, their counsel, the parent/guardian, and the intake officer​
codes.findlaw.com
 – ensuring all stakeholders have a record of the plan and conditions. If the youth successfully completes diversion, the case is dismissed and records can be expunged​
codes.findlaw.com
. If not, or if new information indicates diversion is not in the best interest of the youth or community, the agreement can be terminated and a formal petition filed​
codes.findlaw.com
. Texas: Texas’ juvenile justice code (Title 3, Family Code) similarly emphasizes front-end diversion for low-level offenses. Under Texas Family Code §52.031, county juvenile boards can establish First Offender Programs to handle juveniles taken into custody for minor infractions without filing formal charges​

. Eligible offenses include conduct indicating a need for supervision (status offenses) or misdemeanors that are non-violent​
versustexas.com
. The purpose is explicitly to give first-time youth a second chance and divert them from formal adjudication​
versustexas.com
. Participation is voluntary, requiring agreement by the youth and parent, and police must notify the guardian upon referral​
versustexas.com
. The referring officer completes a written referral form stating the grounds for custody and indicating the youth’s eligibility for diversion​
versustexas.com
. If the program is accepted and completed, no petition is filed and the youth avoids a juvenile record​
versustexas.com
. For more serious alleged offenses, Texas law enforcement may either issue a paper referral (citation) or physically take the juvenile to detention; in all cases a juvenile probation intake officer then reviews the case. At intake, Texas requires standard forms documenting the offense, the juvenile’s demographics, immediate needs (e.g. any medical or mental health concerns), and notification of parents. The intake officer has statutory authority to dispose of certain cases informally (with supervisor or prosecutor approval) or refer the case for formal processing​

​

. Other States’ Frameworks: Neighboring states follow similar legal patterns. Missouri, for example, operates 45 independent juvenile circuits, but all use a common approach: juvenile officers hold an intake inquiry on referrals to decide if the case can be handled informally or needs a petition​
childrens.nebraska.gov
. Diversion in Missouri is strongly encouraged – the state’s Division of Youth Services (DYS) even provides grants to local courts for diversion programs, aiming to “strengthen local systems and reduce commitments”​
childrens.nebraska.gov
. Louisiana law (Children’s Code) likewise permits diversion (informal adjustment agreements) for first-time or low-risk youth, and through its Juvenile Justice Reform Act, Louisiana invested resources to expand these alternatives. In fact, Louisiana’s Office of Juvenile Justice now directs $5 million annually to fund local Diversion and Alternative Detention programs as part of its reform efforts​
ojj.la.gov
. Oklahoma and Tennessee empower juvenile court intake or probation officers to conduct preliminary inquiries. For instance, Arkansas and Oklahoma both require that an intake or probation officer confer with the juvenile and family at an initial meeting, explaining rights and the process. In Oklahoma, if a case is diverted, an agreement (often called a deferred prosecution agreement) is signed by the youth and guardian, outlining conditions like counseling or community service. All these states require that certain forms be completed at intake: e.g. a juvenile rights form (acknowledging the youth was informed of their rights), a complaint or referral form, a risk screening instrument, and oftentimes a medical/mental health screening form. Arkansas’ detention standards explicitly list “Recording of basic personal data” and an “intake interview by a detention worker for risk assessment” as required steps in the admission process​
dps.arkansas.gov
, along with immediate steps like searching the youth, inventorying belongings, and notifying the family​
dps.arkansas.gov
. Across the region, standardized forms ensure that from the moment a youth enters the system, key legal and personal information is captured and that diversion is considered whenever safely possible.
Intake Workflows and Decision Points (Diversion vs. State Custody)
Risk Assessment at Intake: A best practice seen in Arkansas and neighboring states is the use of structured risk/needs assessments at intake to guide decision-making. Arkansas law, for example, now mandates a risk assessment (SAVRY) before disposition​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. Court intake personnel “take an extensive look into a youth’s history as well as current life situation” and score the SAVRY; only if the youth’s risk level is moderate-to-high may a judge commit the youth to state custody (DYS)​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. Low-risk youth, by policy, should be kept in the community (e.g. informal adjustments, diversion programs, or probation). This risk-threshold criterion helps ensure incarceration is “the option of last resort” for Arkansas youth​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. Other states use similar tools: Oklahoma requires the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI) for all juveniles to assess their risk and needs​
oksenate.gov
​
www2.tulsacounty.org
, which directly informs whether a youth can be safely diverted. Texas developed the TJJD Risk and Needs Assessment (RANA) instrument for use by county juvenile probation departments​
www2.tjjd.texas.gov
. While Texas’ intake processes are handled at the county level, nearly all jurisdictions use a detention Risk Assessment Instrument (RAI) at the initial referral stage​
aecf.org
. This RAI is essentially a checklist of factors (current offense, prior history, flight risk, etc.) that produces a score dictating if a youth should be detained or released pending further proceedings​
aecf.org
. If the score is below a cutoff, the youth may be released to a guardian or placed in a diversion program (with referrals to services). If above, detention and formal petition are pursued. Louisiana similarly employs a risk screening at the front door: many jurisdictions use the SAVRY or a brief screening tool to determine if a youth can be referred to one of the OJJ-funded community programs rather than being held. In Mississippi, intake is handled through the county Youth Courts; data from 2022 show that out of 13,893 total intakes, about 25% were diverted and 7% were handled by informal adjustment (agreements without petition)​
cwlibrary.childwelfare.gov
. This indicates Mississippi’s intake officers and judges frequently choose non-custodial paths when possible. Notably, Mississippi’s Division of Youth Services uses the Youth Assessment and Screening Instrument (YASI) to evaluate needs; every youth admitted to the state training school (Oakley) receives a full YASI assessment within 3 days of admission​
mdhs.ms.gov
​
mdhs.ms.gov
, and many counties administer a brief YASI screening earlier in the process to inform the Youth Court’s decisions. Decision Tree – Diversion vs Custody: The common workflow in these states involves several key decision points: (1) Law Enforcement Referral: When an offense occurs, police decide whether to issue a citation (summons) or take the youth into custody. If it’s a minor first-time offense (e.g. a misdemeanor or status offense), officers often have authority to refer directly to a diversion program in lieu of arrest. For example, Texas officers can handle eligible youth through a First Offender Program referral instead of formal detention​
versustexas.com
​
versustexas.com
. Some Texas police departments have memoranda of understanding with juvenile probation for “ cite and release” of low-risk youth to a community program. (2) Intake Screening: If a youth is detained or referred to juvenile court, an intake officer (or prosecutor in some jurisdictions) will review the case. At this stage, the intake officer conducts an interview and gathers initial information – including family circumstances, the youth’s school status, any prior history, and results of the RAI and initial mental health screening (often using the MAYSI-2 screening tool for behavioral health needs, which Arkansas, Louisiana, and others employ system-wide​
craigheadcountyar.gov
). The intake officer then must decide one of several paths:
Diversion: If the offense is minor and the youth is low-risk, the case is diverted. A diversion agreement or informal adjustment is crafted, in which the youth agrees to fulfill certain conditions (e.g. counseling, community service, restitution, a curfew, etc.)​
codes.findlaw.com
. Arkansas specifies that diversion can include referral to community-based programs, nonjudicial probation under an officer’s supervision, enrollment in an educational or counseling program, or even teen court or drug court as alternatives​
codes.findlaw.com
​
codes.findlaw.com
. The duration of diversion supervision is often around 3 to 6 months, after which successful completion leads to case closure​
codes.findlaw.com
. Notably, involvement of the guardian is required – they must consent to the plan and often sign the agreement with the youth​
codes.findlaw.com
. Many jurisdictions also involve the victim at this stage if restitution or apology is part of the agreement.
Formal Processing (Petition to Court): If the youth is not a candidate for diversion – for instance, a felony-level offense or a history of prior delinquency – the intake officer or prosecutor files a petition and the case goes to a judge. Even then, some states use ** graduated responses**. For example, Missouri and Tennessee typically reserve state commitment for only the most serious or chronic cases​
childrens.nebraska.gov
. Missouri DYS notes that its population consists mainly of felonies (about 49% felonies, 37% misdemeanors, and 14% status offenders among commitments)​
childrens.nebraska.gov
, meaning a large share of lower-level cases never reach commitment. If formally processed, the first court stop is a detention or probable cause hearing (within 24-72 hours) where the judge confirms there is reason to hold the youth and often orders a more comprehensive evaluation (psychological or risk/needs assessment) before disposition.
Decision: Probation vs State Custody: At disposition (sentencing), the decision is whether to place the youth on probation in the community (potentially with services like therapy, mentoring, etc.) or commit the youth to a state custody program. This decision is heavily influenced by the earlier risk assessment and recommendations from intake or a multidisciplinary team. In Arkansas, as noted, state custody (DYS commitment) is typically only for moderate- or high-risk youth who need secure placement​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. The judge can also consider intermediate options – e.g. short-term county detention as a disposition in lieu of full commitment. Arkansas law explicitly allows an adjudicated youth to be ordered to a juvenile detention facility for up to 90 days (with rehabilitative services) instead of DYS custody​
law.justia.com
. This provides a shorter, local intervention (essentially a local commitment) as a diversion from state custody. Several states use similar short-term programs: Louisiana has regional reception centers and short-term programs (the Lafayette Parish Evening Reporting Center provides 90-day case management with evidence-based programming as a jail diversion, for example​
thecurrentla.com
), and Oklahoma has state-run group homes that serve as less-restrictive placements for youth who don’t require secure custody.
Throughout these steps, an underlying best practice is structured decision-making: having clear criteria or decision points (often guided by assessment scores and offense severity) ensures consistency and fairness in determining who goes to diversion versus deeper into the system. For instance, Arkansas’ reforms emphasize data-driven decisions and using confinement only when a youth poses a serious risk to public safety​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. Similarly, Texas law now prohibits committing youth to state facilities for misdemeanors (except in rare circumstances), which effectively forces local diversion or probation for those cases. The net result in all these states is that a majority of youth are diverted or placed in community programs, and state custody is a last resort. The workflow designs – including risk triage at intake and formalized diversion agreements – are models that a custom intake application can replicate with branching logic (e.g., if risk score = low and offense = eligible, then prompt diversion options).
Typical Program Durations and Treatment Timeframes
Diversion Program Lengths: Diversion interventions across these states often run on the order of a few months, providing a short but intensive window to correct behavior. A common timeframe is 60–90 days for certain programs. For example, many Louisiana parishes implement a 3-month diversion curriculum: the Acadiana Region’s new Evening Reporting Center provides “90-day case management and links to local services, along with evidence-based assessments and screenings” for youth, rather than prosecution​
thecurrentla.com
. In Arkansas, informal probation or diversion supervision terms are frequently set around 3 to 6 months (as implied by Arkansas Code §9-27-323(e)(1), which envisions a period of nonjudicial supervision with conditions)​
codes.findlaw.com
. If a youth completes all requirements during that period, the case is dismissed​
codes.findlaw.com
. If not, the case can be brought back to court, but even then the total diversion window rarely exceeds 6 months. Missouri’s diversion programs (funded by DYS grants to circuits) likewise tend to be short-term, service-focused engagements – some last 30–45 days of classes or community service for minor cases, whereas others for higher-need youth might last up to 120 days with ongoing counseling. The key is these durations are finite and front-loaded to address issues quickly, since prolonged informal supervision can lead to net-widening. State Custody Stays: For youths who do end up committed to state custody or residential treatment, there are guidelines on length of stay aimed at balancing rehabilitation with avoiding unnecessary confinement. Arkansas has explicitly recognized that the effectiveness of institutional treatment diminishes after about six months​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. As a result, DYS in Arkansas now generally develops treatment plans targeting 3 to 6 months of residential placement for most youth, especially those in therapeutic programs, with a focus on stepping them down to community-based aftercare as soon as it is safe. Indeed, Arkansas’ juvenile justice principles (from the Youth Justice Reform Board) include a recommendation for “limited length of stay” and note that keeping a youth much beyond six months yields diminishing returns​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. In practice, some Arkansas committed youth may stay longer for serious violent offenses, but the median length of stay has been brought down significantly by these reforms. Missouri’s “Missouri Model” is known for its small therapeutic facilities and generally shorter stays – DYS in Missouri retains jurisdiction until age 18 by law​
childrens.nebraska.gov
, but in practice most youth are in residential programs for roughly 4–6 months, followed by several months of aftercare in the community. The Missouri Model’s success has been partly attributed to avoiding lengthy incarceration and instead providing intense treatment in a shorter window followed by support at home​
childrensdefense.org
​
nap.nationalacademies.org
. Short-Term Treatment Programs: Some states have specific short-term programs: for instance, Oklahoma has a program called “Reach” that is around 90 days in a structured residential setting for certain youth, and Tennessee historically had a program for first-time commitments that was 4–5 months at a hardware-secure facility (rather than an indeterminate stay). Many jurisdictions also use 30-day or 45-day diagnostic programs – an initial commitment period during which a comprehensive assessment is done and a treatment plan formulated, after which a recommendation is made to either release or continue treatment. An example is Arkansas’ Central Intake Unit at the state’s Alexander Juvenile Assessment Center (a 140-bed facility) which serves as a centralized intake and assessment location for committed youth​
criminology.fsu.edu
. Youth placed in DYS custody in Arkansas typically go to the central intake center for about 45 days of evaluation, where psychological tests, educational testing, and needs assessments are completed. Then they are assigned to a treatment program or facility suited to their profile – many of those treatment programs aim to discharge the youth after roughly 8 to 12 weeks of core programming, plus aftercare. In summary, best-practice models favor brief, goal-oriented intervention periods: roughly 2–3 months for diversion and around 3–6 months for residential placement (except in truly necessary cases). These timelines align with evidence suggesting that if rehabilitation has not occurred by 6 months, continued confinement is often counterproductive​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. They also make planning more concrete – an intake survey application can incorporate expected duration as a field (e.g. “Anticipated program duration: 90 days”) to set stakeholder expectations from the start. Additionally, having typical timeframes documented (like “diversion supervision = 90 days” or “commitment = up to 6 months”) helps structure the case plan milestones in the system.
Digital Tools for Case Tracking and Documentation
All of these states have modernized (or are modernizing) their juvenile justice information systems, which is crucial for tracking cases from intake through discharge. A standout example is Texas’s Juvenile Case Management System (JCMS) – a comprehensive web-based platform used by all local juvenile probation departments statewide​
tjjd.texas.gov
. JCMS was developed collaboratively by TJJD and Texas counties to serve as a single repository for juvenile case data. It provides data entry interfaces for every stage (referral, intake, detention, court hearings, probation, placement, etc.) and has built-in data sharing so that probation officers, prosecutors, judges, treatment providers, and state officials can access up-to-date information on a case​
tjjd.texas.gov
. JCMS includes standardized fields (drop-down menus) for things like offense details, risk assessment scores, diversion outcomes, and involved parties, enabling “timely and complete information on juvenile offenders” to inform decisions​
tjjd.texas.gov
. An intake survey app could mirror such fields to ensure compatibility with systems like JCMS. For instance, if JCMS expects a “Referral Reason” code or a “Detention Screening Outcome,” the custom intake app can capture those and later feed the data into JCMS or generate reports accordingly. Oklahoma’s system is another instructive model. The Office of Juvenile Affairs (OJA) uses a centralized database called JOLTS (Juvenile On-Line Tracking System) to manage all youth records statewide​
www2.tulsacounty.org
. Every time a youth enters the Oklahoma juvenile system, an electronic file is created or updated in JOLTS. State regulations actually require that any facility or contractor serving justice-involved youth must input data into JOLTS in near real-time. This includes entering the referral information, demographic updates, detention screening results, admission details, and release information for each youth​
www2.tulsacounty.org
​
www2.tulsacounty.org
. For example, when a youth is admitted to a detention center, staff will log into JOLTS and fill out an electronic intake form capturing the offense, date/time of admission, who the guardian is, any immediate alerts (suicidal, medical needs), etc. They also log detention screening scores (i.e., the RAI results) in the system​
www2.tulsacounty.org
. OJA monitors data entry for timeliness, accuracy, and completeness – they specify that entries must be made within 3 working days of admission or release and that the data in JOLTS must match the case file exactly​
www2.tulsacounty.org
. This kind of rigor ensures data quality and shows the importance of having a single source of truth for case data. A custom intake application should be designed either to interface with such a system or at least export data in a format that can be uploaded, to avoid duplicate data entry. Key categories to capture (as OK’s JOLTS does) include: juvenile profile (personal and demographic info), legal details of referral, screening assessments, placement decisions, and status updates like releases​
www2.tulsacounty.org
​
www2.tulsacounty.org
. Other states have similar platforms: Louisiana’s OJJ uses “JETS” (Juvenile Electronic Tracking System) as its centralized database for all youth under supervision or custody​
ojj.la.gov
. JETS tracks each youth’s case from intake forward, and it’s used to record every major event (court hearings, placements, incident reports, etc.). Louisiana is currently working on modernizing this system to a more user-friendly interface​
app.lla.state.la.us
​
modelsforchange.net
, but the concept remains a unified data system. Tennessee integrates juvenile justice tracking into its child welfare system called TFACTS (Tennessee Family and Child Tracking System)​
rmd-rda.tnsos.net
​
digitaltennessee.tnsos.gov
. Thus, a DCS case manager in Tennessee can see both a youth’s delinquency case information and any history with child protective services in one place – an approach that underscores information sharing across systems. Arkansas, while a bit more decentralized (since each judicial district has juvenile intake officers), also made strides: The Administrative Office of Courts provides a juvenile officer database and has been training staff on entering risk assessment data pursuant to Act 189​
arcourts.gov
​
arcourts.gov
. Arkansas DYS, on the state custody side, maintains a case management system for committed youth and publishes performance dashboards and statistical reports using those data​
humanservices.arkansas.gov
. From a best-practice standpoint, the following digital features are particularly useful and replicable:
Common Data Standards: All these systems use standard definitions (e.g., what constitutes a “referral”, what disposition codes are allowed)​
tjjd.texas.gov
. A custom intake survey should align with those standards. For instance, Texas JCMS and Oklahoma JOLTS both have fields for “Referral Source” (police, school, parent, etc.), “Alleged Offense,” “Detention Risk Score,” “Diversion Outcome (Y/N and type)”, etc. Including those fields in the intake app ensures consistency.
Sharing and Notifications: Systems like JCMS enable sharing data with all who need to know​
tjjd.texas.gov
. A good intake workflow might automatically notify the next stakeholder – for example, once intake is done and if the youth is diverted, an email or report could be sent to the diversion program contact. Similarly, if a petition is filed, data can be forwarded to the prosecutor’s system.
Security and Confidentiality: Given juvenile data sensitivity, these state systems enforce strict access control. An intake app must authenticate users and perhaps differentiate what different roles can see or edit (probation officer vs. service provider, etc.)​
tjjd.texas.gov
.
Audit Trails: Oklahoma’s monitoring of data entry timeliness​
www2.tulsacounty.org
​
www2.tulsacounty.org
 points to having audit logs – useful for accountability (e.g., ensuring that an intake survey was fully completed within 24 hours of admission).
In short, leveraging the existing state platforms’ structure will make the custom intake survey more effective. For example, using drop-down options drawn from state codes (offense codes, disposition codes) can later let you export intake records directly into the state’s system. The goal is to avoid siloed data; instead, the intake survey app can be the data capture front-end that feeds the official databases like JCMS, JOLTS, JETS, etc., thereby streamlining documentation and reducing duplicate work.
Educational Planning and Handling of School Records
Education is a critical component of juvenile justice processing, and all states require that a youth’s schooling continue uninterrupted as much as possible, whether they are in detention or under supervision. A few notable models highlight how educational planning is handled: Arkansas – Education in Detention: Arkansas law explicitly addresses education for youth even during short-term detention. Under Ark. Code §6-20-104, any juvenile detention facility (JDF) holding adjudicated youth (as part of a disposition) “must provide educational and other rehabilitative services” to those youth​
law.justia.com
. A judge may order an adjudicated delinquent to serve up to 90 days in a local JDF, but during that time the facility is responsible for schooling the youth​
law.justia.com
. The statute sets up a process where the facility and the local school district coordinate: once the court orders the youth to JDF, the facility must notify the juvenile’s resident school district of the placement and, upon the youth’s release, certify the dates the youth was detained​
law.justia.com
. The school district where the JDF is located and the facility then jointly apply for state education funds to cover the youth’s educational services while detained​
law.justia.com
. This ensures the youth is treated as a student (not a dropout) and that academic credit can be awarded. For an intake survey context, this implies the importance of capturing education information at intake: e.g., current school, grade, any special education status (IEP/504), and contacts for the school. Arkansas’ approach shows that those details need to be communicated to whoever provides schooling in custody. Indeed, best practice is that at the moment of intake or admission to a program, staff request the youth’s school records (transcripts, attendance, IEP) from their last school. Many juvenile facilities have an education liaison who uses a standard form to request records from the school within 48 hours of placement. Records Transfer and Re-enrollment: In planning for a youth’s eventual return to school, states like Louisiana and Tennessee emphasize reentry coordination. Louisiana’s OJJ, for example, has policies that when a youth is nearing release from a secure care facility, the case manager must assemble an education portfolio including copies of all current education records and any vocational training certificates​
ojj.la.gov
. These are shared with the family and the receiving school to facilitate re-enrollment. Louisiana law (Children’s Code art. 912) even requires that if a youth is adjudicated and removed from their school, the school must reserve their spot or promptly re-enroll them upon return, and OJJ counselors help with this transition. Tennessee Code Annotated §37-5-131 stresses that facilities (whether state or local) providing education to detained youth must report data to the Department of Education, which in turn works on accountability and transition programs​
law.justia.com
​
law.justia.com
. In practice, Tennessee DCS has Education Specialists who develop an Individual Education Plan for each committed youth, ensuring that credits earned in custody will transfer to the youth’s home school. A custom intake form should therefore capture academic information such as last grade completed, any credit deficiencies, special education needs, and the name of the youth’s last school/district. This data will drive the educational planning process. For instance, if the youth is behind in credits, the placement might focus on credit recovery. If the youth has an IEP, the facility must provide the required services – meaning the intake process should flag that and prompt obtaining the IEP document immediately. Handling School Discipline vs Delinquency: Another facet is when the justice system intersects with school-based offenses. Texas pioneered Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Programs (JJAEPs) for students expelled from school for serious misbehavior (often those cases overlap with delinquency). In counties with JJAEPs, a youth who is expelled may attend the JJAEP during their expulsion term. An intake survey could note if the offense occurred on campus or if the youth is currently suspended/expelled, as this affects educational placement. Texas Education Code §37.011 requires JJAEPs to operate at least 7 hours a day, 180 days a year to provide a full academic program​
codes.findlaw.com
, so youths in those programs continue earning credits. The interplay between juvenile justice and education is such that information-sharing is codified: Many states (Arkansas included) have provisions that the juvenile court shall inform the school of a student’s adjudication for certain offenses, and conversely schools share attendance/behavior records with the court for disposition. An intake application might incorporate a consent or release for educational records under FERPA, so that all parties are legally allowed to exchange the youth’s educational data. Summary of Best Practices for Education Planning: At intake or shortly after, assemble a team or at least a plan for the youth’s education:
If the youth is in diversion or probation, ensure they remain enrolled in school. The intake officer often checks attendance records. For example, if truancy was an issue, part of the diversion plan will include attendance monitoring. The survey could include fields like “Current school attendance %” or “Truancy issues Y/N” to document that.
If the youth is going into any form of custody (detention or residential), initiate an education plan: notify the home school of the change in placement (Arkansas requires notification within 5 days of a juvenile’s release as well, to help the school reconcile attendance)​
law.justia.com
. Also, enroll the youth in the facility’s school program without delay. Missouri DYS facilities, for instance, enroll youth in an on-site school that operates year-round; Missouri considers education a centerpiece of rehabilitation and even includes vocational training as part of longer stays.
Plan for records and credit transfer at exit. The survey/system can have a checklist for release where the case worker confirms that transcripts and diplomas (or HiSET/GED if attained) have been forwarded to the next school or employer.
By gathering educational info at intake and prompting staff to follow up, a custom application can reduce youths “falling through the cracks” in terms of schooling. One replicable data structure is an “Education” section in the intake form that includes fields like: School ID, Grade, Special Ed status, Last report card grades, Enrollment status (active/withdrawn), Credits earned, Behavioral issues at school. Such data not only aid planning but also help measure outcomes (like improvement in school performance as a result of the intervention).
Documenting Involved Parties and Team Collaboration
Juvenile cases typically involve a web of stakeholders – and effective models make sure to document all these involved parties from the outset and keep them in the communication loop. An intake survey application should capture the contact information and roles of each party connected to the youth. Here’s how states approach it:
Youth’s Family/Guardians: All states prioritize involvement of the youth’s guardian or custodian at every stage. As noted, Texas requires that a parent or guardian be notified and consent for a First Offender Program diversion​
versustexas.com
. Arkansas similarly involves parents in intake interviews and diversion plans​
bobbydigbylaw.com
. The family guide in Arkansas advises parents to be “actively involved in your child’s case,” attending all meetings with probation or intake officers​
katc.com
​
katc.com
. To facilitate this, the intake process will record the primary custodial parent’s name, address, phone, employer, etc., as well as any alternate guardian (for example, if the youth lives with a grandparent). Many jurisdictions also note if the youth is under the care of the child welfare system (foster care) – that triggers involvement of a foster parent or caseworker instead. Best practice is to have a designated field for legal guardian and another for emergency contact/secondary guardian in the intake form. This was seen in Oklahoma’s JOLTS data requirements, which include establishing the juvenile’s file with all demographic info and relationships​
www2.tulsacounty.org
​
www2.tulsacounty.org
. Keeping guardian info current is vital (if a youth’s living arrangements change, the record is updated).
Probation/Intake Officer: The person conducting the intake often becomes the youth’s supervision officer if the case is diverted or put on informal probation. For clarity, the case record should note the assigned officer’s name and contact. In Arkansas, each case has an intake officer of record; Arkansas courts even have a Juvenile Officer Assignment form in some districts. Missouri’s decentralized system means each circuit’s juvenile officer is effectively the case manager pre-disposition; once a youth is committed to DYS, a DYS case manager takes over. Therefore, noting the handoff (who is the DYS case manager vs who was the court’s officer) is useful.
Judge and Court: On formal cases, the presiding judge and court jurisdiction should be logged. This can be important if the youth is involved in multiple cases (say, in two different counties) or if conditions of release need to be communicated to the correct court. A field for “Court/Docket Number” and “Judge’s Name” can be part of the structured data.
Attorneys: Juveniles have a right to counsel. Many diversion processes occur before a petition is filed, and often the family waives immediate counsel to participate in diversion. However, best practice (like in Arkansas code) is that the juvenile consults with an attorney or advisor before entering a diversion agreement​
codes.findlaw.com
. The intake record should reflect if an attorney is involved. If so, capture the defense attorney’s name (public defender or private) and contact. Likewise, if a prosecutor has been involved in reviewing the case (for example, some counties require prosecutor approval of diversion for felony-level charges), note the prosecutor’s name. Having these contacts logged ensures that later notices (like outcomes or if the case returns to court) can be sent to the right people. A structured field for “Defense Counsel (Y/N)” with name/address if yes, and “Prosecutor” can cover this.
Service Providers/Treatment Team: Juvenile justice increasingly uses a multidisciplinary approach. For instance, Louisiana OJJ emphasizes a “multidisciplinary team” to develop the youth’s service plan​
ojj.la.gov
. This team might include a therapist, a counselor, a school representative, and others. Missouri’s model also actively involves caseworkers, education specialists, and sometimes mentors. During intake, one may not know all team members yet, but it’s important to document known ones. For example, if the youth is already seeing a therapist or counselor, list that person (and whether the youth will continue seeing them). If the youth is in foster care, list the foster care caseworker. If the family has a mentor through a community program, that’s another stakeholder. In diversion cases, often the youth is referred to specific programs (e.g., an evening reporting center, a substance abuse counselor, an anger management class). The intake survey can generate a referral list and then record the assigned provider for each service.
Victim or Community Representative: In some cases (especially for diversion or restoration programs), victim involvement is important. For example, a diversion may require the youth to write an apology or pay restitution to the victim. The victim’s information (name, contact) is usually kept confidential in public records but is available to the officers handling restitution. A secure part of the record might include victim ID and whether restitution is owed. Arkansas’s statute allows restitution to be part of diversion agreements​

, so that would entail tracking payments, etc., often by the juvenile officer or clerk​

.
Effective Collaboration Models: A notable best practice is conducting family team meetings soon after intake, which is common in Tennessee’s juvenile justice because DCS applies a family-focused model from child welfare. In such a meeting, all parties (family, youth, probation officer, service providers, sometimes the judge or a facilitator) discuss the case plan. Documenting outcomes of these meetings (decisions, who will do what) is crucial. Some jurisdictions include a team meeting report in the case file. A custom application might integrate a meeting scheduler or at least a notes section to log multi-party conferences. Another replicable structure is the use of case plan documents that list the responsibilities of each party. Louisiana, for instance, creates an individualized plan for each youth​
ojj.la.gov
 that outlines what OJJ will do (provide XYZ services), what the youth will do (attend school, counseling, etc.), and what the family will do (participate in family therapy, ensure transportation). These plans are signed by the youth, family, and agency. Capturing the elements of such plans in a survey form (even if not all done at initial intake) can be extremely useful. For example, fields like “Needs identified (check all that apply): Mental Health, Substance Abuse, Educational, Family, Trauma, etc.” and then “Services to be provided: ___”. This structured needs/services inventory becomes the backbone of case management. Lastly, states like Missouri and Arkansas stress ongoing communication: Arkansas requires that upon completion of diversion or discharge from DYS, notice is given in writing to the youth and guardian​

. Ensuring that the database has up-to-date addresses and contacts for those parties is necessary for such notices. Similarly, if a youth absconds or violates probation, warrants or pickup orders are issued and parents are contacted; having the guardian contact info readily available in the system is vital for quick communication. In sum, a custom intake system should treat party documentation as a first-class component. Best practices to emulate include:
Comprehensive contact list: For each case, maintain a directory of all persons involved (with role labels like “Mother – Jane Doe, 555-1234”; “Probation Officer – John Smith, email...”; “Judge – Hon. Brown”; “Therapist – Dr. Jones, clinic...”).
Consent and information sharing: Document permissions (e.g., did the parent sign a release for the officer to speak with the school or therapist? Many jurisdictions get a blanket release at intake).
Automated reminders: possibly, send appointment letters or text reminders to guardians about upcoming court dates or meetings – some counties in Oklahoma and Texas use automated systems for that.
By front-loading the identification of all key players and keeping that info updated, the juvenile justice process becomes more coordinated and youth are less likely to fall off track due to miscommunication. A well-designed intake survey app can ensure that no stakeholder is overlooked by requiring those fields and perhaps not allowing a case to progress until, say, a parent or guardian is listed and has received a copy of the initial paperwork (which, as a feature, the app could generate in PDF form for them to sign).
Notable Effective Models to Emulate
In reviewing Arkansas and its neighbors, a few models stand out as particularly effective or innovative, offering ideas that could be adapted into the intake survey and workflow design:
The Missouri Model (Rehabilitative Small Facilities): Missouri’s approach over the past few decades (“Missouri Miracle” as it’s sometimes called) emphasizes treatment in small, home-like facilities and heavy family involvement​

. While this is a broader philosophy, at the intake stage it means Missouri’s juvenile system works hard to keep youth out of large detention centers and instead assess if they can be served in community or, if not, commit them to DYS’s highly therapeutic programs. A practical element to borrow is Missouri DYS’s commitment classification: each committed youth is assessed and classified to a certain level of custody (from community-based group home to secure care) based on risk. This is something the intake survey could incorporate: a decision tree or field for “Recommended Placement Level” after evaluating offense severity and risk score. Missouri also has a strong aftercare planning process that starts at intake – essentially planning for reentry from day one. The intake form could include a question like “Anticipated living situation upon release (if applicable)” to initiate that forward-looking mindset.
Arkansas’ Risk-Based Commitment Criteria: Arkansas made it law that low-risk kids should not be in state custody​

. This is a best practice that can be baked into software – for example, if a user tries to indicate “Commit to DYS” for a youth whose SAVRY risk level is low, the system might flag this as inconsistent with best practices. Instead, it could prompt: “Youth is low risk – consider diversion or alternative.” This kind of decision support, reflecting Arkansas’ model, helps operationalize the legal framework.
Texas’ Diversion Investments and JCMS integration: Texas keeps the vast majority of youth at the local level; one reason this works is the comprehensive data system (JCMS) that links all counties and the state. For a custom intake tool, emulating JCMS fields (per above) ensures that data collected are immediately useful. Additionally, Texas has specialized diversion programs worth noting: for example, the Front-End Diversion Initiative (FEDI) which is a mental health diversion program in some counties, and various mentoring programs for first offenders. The common thread is identifying special needs early. So the survey should have robust screening sections – e.g., a brief mental health screen (MAYSI-2 results can be entered, or at least a flag for “acute mental health needs Y/N”) and trauma screening. Several states now do a trauma screening at intake because many court-involved youth have past trauma that, if identified, can shape the intervention. Ensuring the app collects that (or interfaces with a screening tool) would be forward-thinking.
Louisiana’s Juvenile Justice Reform (JJRIA): Louisiana’s recent reforms, funded by reinvestment, encourage innovation like evening reporting centers, community supervision in lieu of detention, and collaborative planning with schools and mental health providers. An example to highlight is the structured decision-making tool Louisiana uses for detention: a Detention Screening Instrument that assigns points and recommends release or hold. The Lafayette Juvenile Assessment Center model (in development) co-locates social workers at intake to connect families to services immediately. For an intake system, incorporating a referral generator – i.e., based on the identified needs (substance abuse, family conflict, etc.), the app could list recommended local programs – would parallel Louisiana’s approach of coordinating services at the first point of contact​

Oklahoma’s Data-Driven Oversight: Oklahoma requires contractors (like county detention centers) to update bed availability in JOLTS twice daily and maintains real-time data on facility population (“Quick Beds”)​
www2.tulsacounty.org
. This is a neat idea for efficiency – a custom system might include a dashboard of available program slots or beds for the intake officer. For example, if a youth needs to be placed in a shelter or treatment center, the system could show which ones have openings (if such data can be integrated). It makes the decision of “where to place the youth” much faster and is something Oklahoma has tackled by making capacity data part of its system.
Family Engagement Strategies: Tennessee and Missouri both strongly emphasize engaging families (Missouri holds family therapy weekends, Tennessee uses Child and Family Team Meetings). A concrete application of this is requiring a family contact/visit plan at intake. The survey could ask: “Who are the supportive family members or mentors in the youth’s life that we should involve?” This open-ended but guided question prompts the officer to list grandmother, uncle, pastor, etc., who could be assets. That information can lead to better outcomes and mirrors what successful programs do (e.g., a parent support specialist reaches out to those people).
In conclusion, the actionable and structured insights gleaned from these states boil down to: use validated assessments to drive decisions; collect comprehensive data on the youth’s background and support system; favor diversion and short-term interventions whenever appropriate; ensure education is not disrupted and plan for reentry early; and leverage technology for information sharing and accountability. By building these elements into a custom intake survey application – in the form of required fields, built-in logic (based on models like Arkansas’ SAVRY requirement or Texas’ offense-based diversion eligibility), and linkages to education and service referrals – one can create a tool that not only gathers information but also guides the user toward best-practice pathways. The end result should be an intake process that is consistent, fair, and oriented toward rehabilitation, much like the successful models in Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Oklahoma that we have explored.
